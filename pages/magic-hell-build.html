        <h1>Magic Hell Mode Build</h1>
        <p>
          This is a summary of the most popular hell mode meta build, the magic
          build.
        </p>

        <h2>The Mythics</h2>
        <p>
          <b>Main</b>
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li>Lance - level 12</li>
          <li>Tao - level 12/15</li>
          <li>Watt - level 12</li>
          <li>Kun - level 6 (early wave clear if first legendary is tiger)</li>
          <li>Kitty - level 12</li>
          <li>Frog - level doesn't matter</li>
        </ul>
        <p><b>Optional</b></p>
        <ul>
          <li>Dian - level 12</li>
          <li>Zap - level 12</li>
          <li>Drain - level 12</li>
          <li>Meow V2 - mostly for gold gain, ideally level 12</li>
          <li>Indy 12</li>
          <li>
            Mono 12 (yes, optional. You can destroy later if reaper/magician
            appears)
          </li>
          <li>Grav 12</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
          Having exclusive treasures on the main mythics helps a bunch of
          course. Also, it's not reccomended to use Dragon, only Drain.
        </p>
        <h3>Gold</h3>
        <p>
          You're going to need as much gold as possible to clear realistically.
          You'll want to learn to stack gold as aggressively as possible. Early
          eagles and frog can support your bandits for more gold gain. You don't
          really want to rely on frog as a wave clear because he's inconsistent
          in general. But if you happen to get a Dian after using Frog to boost
          your gold gain from Bandit, well that's awesome. Or you can keep frog
          to the end. Both can be good choices.
        </p>
        <h3>Wave Clearing</h3>
        <p>
          Tao 12 is the bread and butter of this build. He does really solid
          boss damage. His strongest move is not his ult, but his skill that has
          a % chance of happening every time you attack. Because of this, and
          Watt, building up attack speed is the core concept of this build. Watt
          will be covered in the boss section. Tao is extremely good at clearing
          waves though. Not only is he good at it, but he doesn't take up space
          on the frontline because of this huge range. This means he's popular
          even in physical/hybrid builds. You can just throw him down and forget
          and he'll clear waves for you.
        </p>
        <p>
          Kun can clear waves as well. While Kun is weaker than Tao, he can be a
          good summon if you get Tiger early and can't summon Tao for a bit. He
          takes a bit of time to build up mana to to roll rage, but he's a solid
          unit.
        </p>
        <p>
          Lancelot is also a good unit to use because while he's known more as a
          boss killer, with enough mp regen from Kitty Mage he can do really
          strong damage against waves as well, even at the lowest Safebox
          levels. Even at sb6 though, his contribution to wave clear is still
          very high.
        </p>
        <h3>Beating the Bosses</h3>
        <p>
          While Tao benefits from attack speed, this is where the entire crux of
          this strategy comes into play - Watt 12. Watt's playstyle is that his
          normal attacks, while very weak, have a chance to add +1 to his stack
          every time they hit an enemy. When you pop his ult, his attack speed
          doubles, <b>and his attack increases by +5% for each stack he has.</b>
        </p>
        <p>
          This ability is extremely strong. Nothing in the game is as strong as
          a Watt that's been left to charge for half the game. Especially
          because the higher you boost attack speed, the faster he builds
          stacks, and the quicker he unleashes those stacks when using his ult.
          This is even better, because it synergizes with Taoist, who improves
          more with attack speed than anything else, and you don't need any
          Defense Reduction for either of them leaving plenty of space for
          attack speed buffs like eagle and frog.
        </p>
