        <h2><u>The enemy defense stat</u></h2>
        
        <p>
            In Lucky Defense enemies have a defense stat. Early on, enemies
            have a low defense stat. As the waves get higher and higher,
            the enemies that appear have higher and higher defense.
            If they have a high defense, you do less damage. <strong>They can ignore
            around 80% of the damage you deal to them if
            they have high defense.</strong> But if they have a really low defense stat,
            you actually get <strong>bonus</strong> damage. <strong>You can get so
            much bonus damage that you nearly double the
            damage they take.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            The defense stat of the enemies only protects them from physical
            damage. Some characters do magic damage. The most common magic
            DPS characters are
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>King Dian</li>
            <li>Dragon</li>
            <li>Lancelot</li>
            <li>Iron Meow</li>
            <li>Lazy Taoist</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>None of the damage these characters deal will be affected by
            an enemies defense stat.</strong>
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Defense <b>DOES</b> affect the damage
            physical characters deal though. The most common physical DPS are
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Batman</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu</li>
            <li>Tar</li>
            <li>Vayne</li>
            <li>Blob</li>
            <li>Bomba</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            <strong>Any of the damage these characters deal will be affected by
            the enemy defense stat</strong>
        </p>

        <h2><u>How can you see enemy defense stats?</u></h2>

        <p>
            You can actually see <b>exactly</b> how your damage is getting effected
            by the enemy defense stat.
