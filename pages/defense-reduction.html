              In Lucky Defense enemies have a defense stat. Early on, enemies have a
              low defense stat. As the waves get higher and higher, the enemies that
              appear have higher and higher defense. If they have a high defense,
              you do less damage.
              <strong
                >They can ignore around 80% of the damage you deal to them if they
                have high defense.</strong
              >
              But if they have a really low defense stat, you actually get
              <strong>bonus</strong> damage.
              <strong
                >You can get so much bonus damage that you nearly double the damage
                they take.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-header">Which attacks does defense block?</h2>
            <p>
              The defense stat of the enemies only protects them from physical
              damage. Some characters do magic damage. The most common magic DPS
              characters are
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>King Dian</li>
              <li>Dragon</li>
              <li>Lancelot</li>
              <li>Iron Meow</li>
              <li>Lazy Taoist</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong
                >None of the damage these characters deal will be affected by an
                enemies defense stat.</strong
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Defense <b>DOES</b> affect the damage physical characters deal though.
              The most common physical DPS are
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Batman</li>
              <li>Rocket Chu</li>
              <li>Tar</li>
              <li>Vayne</li>
              <li>Blob</li>
              <li>Bomba</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              <strong
                >Any of the damage these characters deal will be affected by the

            <h2 class="section-header">How can you see enemy defense stats?</h2>
            <p>
              You can actually see <b>exactly</b> how your damage is getting
              effected by the enemy defense stat by clicking on this icon I've
              circled in green.
            </p>
            <img
              src="../pics/defense-reduce/LowDefenseReduce.jpg"
              class="max-width-img"
            />
            <p>The effect here is "Physical DMG Decrease - 68.9%"</p>
            <p>
              This is a huge loss of damage. This means that if you have 2 batmen
              you'll do less damage than 1 full batman with good defense reduce.
              (DR)
            </p>
            <p>
              Alternatively, here's an example of doing <b>extra</b> damage using
              defense reduce
            </p>
            <img
              src="../pics/defense-reduce/HighDefenseReduce.jpg"
              class="max-width-img"
            />
            <h2 class="section-header">How can I reduce enemy defense?</h2>
            <p>
              To actually reduce the enemy defense is much easier than trying to get
              a second Batman, Rocket Chu, or any DPS mythic. Lots of non mythic
              units in the game give defense reduction (DR) just for existing. These
              are the units most commonly used for defense reduction (DR)
            </p>
            <ul>
              <li>Hunter - 10 DR (15 DR at level 12)</li>
              <li>Monopoly Man - 20 DR (This is a lot)</li>
              <li>
                Electro Robot - 5 DR (This is a lot less, but you need stun anyways)
              </li>
              <li>Demon - 5 DR (7.5 at level 12)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
              These are just the ones I've used most often to get more DR. There are
              other units in the game that give DR. I reccomend getting familar with
              all the units, and reading through all their skills. The nonmythic
              units are a very important part of winning runs in this game and are
              an important piece in learning to win runs regularly and easily.
            </p>
            <h2 class="section-header">Summary</h2>
            <p>
              This may seem like a lot if you've just started playing Lucky Defense.
              However, knowing this stuff will give you an edge that most beginners
              don't have. Not only that, but defense reduction is one of the most
              important mechanics to understand before you can start clearing hard
              regularly. Once you know it well, you could even try to carry people
              through their first hard mode clears, even if you have low artifact
              levels (sb/mg 1). I reccomend getting Kitty Mage 12 though, as that
              will make beating hard <b>much</b> easier.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not sure what sb/mg means? Check out the explanation
              <a href="./sb-mg.html">here.</a>
            </p>

            <p>Good luck!</p>
