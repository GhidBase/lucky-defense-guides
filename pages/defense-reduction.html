                        In Lucky Defense enemies have a defense stat. Early on,
                        enemies have a low defense stat. As the waves get higher
                        and higher, the enemies that appear have higher and
                        higher defense. If they have a high defense, you do less
                        damage.
                        <strong
                            >They can ignore around 80% of the damage you deal
                            to them if they have high defense.</strong
                        >
                        But if they have a really low defense stat, you actually
                        get
                        <strong>bonus</strong> damage.
                        <strong
                            >You can get so much bonus damage that you nearly
                            double the damage they take.</strong

                        The defense stat of the enemies only protects them from
                        physical damage. Some characters do magic damage. The
                        most common magic DPS characters are

                        Defense <b>DOES</b> affect the damage physical
                        characters deal though. The most common physical DPS are

                    <p>
                        You can actually see <b>exactly</b> how your damage is
                        getting effected by the enemy defense stat by clicking
                        on this icon I've circled in green.

                        class="max-width-img"

                    />
                    <p>The effect here is "Physical DMG Decrease - 68.4%"</p>
                    <p>
                        This is a huge loss of damage. This means that if you
                        have 2 batmen you'll do less damage than 1 full batman
                        with good defense reduction. (DR)

                        Alternatively, here's an example of doing
                        <b>extra</b> damage using defense reduction
                    </p>

                        How can I reduce enemy defense?
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        To actually reduce the enemy defense is much easier than
                        trying to get a second Batman, Rocket Chu, or any DPS
                        mythic. Lots of non-mythic units in the game give
                        defense reduction (DR) just for existing. These are the
                        units most commonly used for defense reduction (DR)
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hunter - 10 DR (15 DR at level 12)</li>
                        <li>Monopoly Man - 20 DR (This is a lot)</li>
                        <li>
                            Electro Robot - 5 DR (This is a lot less, but you
                            need stun anyways)
                        </li>
                        <li>Demon - 5 DR (7.5 at level 12)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        These are just the ones I've used most often to get more
                        DR. There are other units in the game that give DR. I
                        recommend getting familiar with all the units, and
                        reading through all their skills. The non-mythic units
                        are a very important part of winning runs in this game
                        and are an important piece in learning to win runs
                        regularly and easily.

                        This may seem like a lot if you've just started playing
                        Lucky Defense. However, knowing this stuff will give you
                        an edge that most beginners don't have. Not only that,
                        but defense reduction is one of the most important
                        mechanics to understand before you can start clearing
                        hard regularly. Once you know it well, you could even
                        try to carry people through their first hard mode
                        clears, even if you have low artifact levels (sb/mg 1).
                        I recommend getting Kitty Mage 12 though, as that will
                        make beating hard <b>much</b> easier.
                    </p>
