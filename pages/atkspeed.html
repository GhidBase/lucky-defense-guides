          <p>
            ATK SPD is a very important stat, ATK SPD directly converts to
            attacks per second, which means 2 ATK SPD is 2 attacks per second.
          </p>
          <p>
            You may have noticed that your passive attack speed bonus increases
            the ATK SPD by a bit more than expected, this is because of a couple
            things:
            <ul>
                <li>Fairy Bow</li>
                <li>Treasures</li>
                <li>Pets</li>
                <li>Active Skills</li>
            </ul>
          </p>
          <p>
            All of these magnify the passive attack speed increases coming from Eagles, Tigers, Frogs, and Indys. The formula for increase in ATK SPD looks like this:
            <ul>
                <li>Base ATK SPD x (Your Fairy Bow x2 + Treasure + Pet + Active skill) x In-game passive attack speed increase</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
          <p>
            Another thing you may have noticed from the formula is that Fairy Bow's value is actually twice of what it says it is. Meaning for example, a level 1 Fairy Bow is actually a 16% attack speed increase instead of 8%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Because of the multiplicative effect between active and passive attack speed buffs, you will want Tiger Master (for Shout) and/or Penguin Musician (for Allegro) to further benefit from your passive attack speed increase effects.
          </p>
          <p>
            Note that Shout and Allegro stack with each other but not with themselves. Ie. Two Tigers Shout-ing at the same time will only contribute 20% to the calculation and not 40% but a Shout and an Allegro at the same time will contribute 40%. Hence only one of each is needed, which makes them a worthwhile investment for minimal population capacity.
          </p>
          <p>
            Keep in mind that these active skills have a range, so they will not be able to affect the whole field unlike the passive attack speed increases, and they will have downtime due to being a chance-based skill.
