                        Immortal Guardians unlock when you get any Mythic
                        Guardian to level 15. After you unlock them, there will
                        be a new section in the Guardian Tab
                    </p>
                    <div class="centered-imgs">

                    <p>
                        To unlock an Immortal Guardian, you have to bring the
                        mythic version of that Guardian up to level 15. After
                        unlocking an Immortal Guardian, you can summon one copy
                        of it at a time in any game. Each immortal guardian has
                        their own summon requirements. Also, each immortal
                        guardian has a different level, separate from the level
                        of their mythic form. To level up an Immortal you need
                        to use Immortal Stones instead of Mythic Stones. As of
                        now, the only way to get Immortal Stones is through:

                    <p>
                        Below is a list of all the different Immortal Guardians.
                        It'll explain how to actually summon them, since they
                        have unique summon methods, it'll discuss their
                        role/playstyle, and have a video of them being used.
                    </p>

                    <h1>Reaper Frog/Reaper Dian</h1>
                    <h2>Playstyle</h2>
                    <h3>Frog Form</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reaper Frog is a Physical Damage DPS Guardian. He's easy
                        to summon, and he does good damage. He has two forms:
                        Frog Form, and Dian Form. Unlike the Mythic Frog Form,
                        Immortal Reaper Frog is a very solid DPS unit. He has
                        damage comparative to Lazy Taoist or Overclocked Rocket
                        Chu. He's also much cheaper to summon than Rocket Chu,
                        which is very good since they both have a chance to die
                        when being summoned, meaning the risk is lower when
                        summoning Reaper Frog, although Rocket Chu does have a
                        higher success rate at 50% versus Frogs 35%.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Reaper Frog's summon cost is low enough that at Luck
                        Stone level 6+, he can somewhat consistently be summoned
                        before wave 20 on Hell Mode. He can easily carry until
                        wave 40, usually including the wave 40 boss. This makes
                        him a great unit to allow you to stack econ, and slowly
                        build the rest of your board. He also applies 80 slow to
                        enemies with his skill "Suppression", which is overall a
                        great skill to have as it prevents stun leaks. For
                        comparison, the Mythic Guardian Coldy applies 50 slow
                        with her passive, and 50 slow with her skill, and
                        Penguin Musician applies 60 with his skill. So Reaper
                        Frog's 80 slow is one of the stronger slows in the game.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Dian Form</h3>
                    <p>
                        Reaper Dian is a Magic Damage DPS Guardian. When you get
                        Reaper Frog, you can do the same curse lift ability the
                        standard frog has to transform him into Reaper Dian. It
                        has a 35% chance to succeed by default, increasing to a
                        50% chance to succeed at level 12. Reaper Dian is a
                        significant upgrade overall. There have been videos of
                        high level players clearing Hell Mode with Reaper Dian
                        as the only DPS on the board. His skills and passives
                        all revolve around dealing massive damage.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Reaper Frog is the easiest to summon out of the first 3
                        Immortal Guardians. To get a him, all you need to do is
                        turn a normal frog into a Dian. Once you get a Dian, at
                        any point you will be able to convert it into a Reaper
                        Frog. From there, you can try to curse lift your Reaper
                        Frog, into his Reaper Dian Form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To get a Reaper Dian more easily, you can keep making
                        Dians from the normal Mythic Frog. When you have both a
                        Dian and a Reaper Frog on the board, if you try to lift
                        the curse on the Frog and it fails, you can immediately
                        turn your Dian into a Reaper Frog. You can use this
                        strategy to make multiple attempts at Reaper Dian,
                        without having to give up having his base Frog Form if
                        you fail.
