                                An Immortal Guardian unlocks when you get their
                                mythic form to level 15. Once the mythic form is
                                level 15, you can pay 6000 gems to unlock the
                                immortal form. The actual "Immortal" tab to view
                                Immortal Guardians unlocks once you get any
                                mythic to level 12.

                                After being unlocked, each immortal guardian has
                                their own summon requirements in-game. NOTE:
                                Only one copy of an Immortal can be summoned at
                                a time. For Immortals with two forms like Reaper
                                Frog, only one of those forms can be summoned at
                                a time.

                                    Each immortal guardian has a different level
                                    separate from the level of their mythic
                                    form, and it starts at level 1. Note that
                                    they're typically still very strong at level
                                    1, but the upgrades are notable increases in
                                    strength. Level 1 to level 6 is fairly easy
                                    to get, and is worth going for right after
                                    unlocking an Immortal. To level them up you
                                    need Immortal Stones instead of Mythic
                                    Stones. As of now, the only way to get
                                    Immortal Stones is through:

                                None of the Immortals are directly affected by
                                Mythic Treasures. It's worth noting that the
                                first 3 all do benefit from them on the way to
                                summon them. The Mythic Frog's treasure gives
                                some material back if a curse lift is failed.
                                This means that it's easier to try again after
                                each failed curse lift. Mama's treasure lets her
                                summon imps more quickly. Hailey's treasure
                                allows her to gather Star Power more quickly.
                                All of these effects speed up their ability to
                                turn into their immortal form, but once in the
                                form they don't hold these treasures or benefit
                                from any of the effects.

                                In Hell and God Mode, there's a boss called
                                Night Shaman that can change your Guardians into
                                other Guardians. One of the best traits of
                                Immortal Guardians is that they cannot be
                                changed into another Guardian. This makes them
                                even better than they would already be just
                                being higher tier characters with more damage,
                                because it gives your board some resilience.

                                Reaper Frog is a Physical Damage DPS Guardian.
                                He's easy to summon, and he does good damage. He
                                has two forms: Frog Form, and Dian Form. Unlike
                                the Mythic Frog Form, Immortal Reaper Frog is a
                                very solid DPS unit. He has damage comparative
                                to Lazy Taoist or Overclocked Rocket Chu. He's
                                also much cheaper to summon than Rocket Chu,
                                which is very good since they both have a chance
                                to die when being summoned, meaning the risk is
                                lower when summoning Reaper Frog, although
                                Rocket Chu does have a higher success rate at
                                50% versus Frogs 35%.
                            </p>

                                Reaper Frog's summon cost is low enough that at
                                Luck Stone level 6+, he can somewhat
                                consistently be summoned before wave 20 on Hell
                                Mode. Since all you have to do is get a King
                                Dian, you'll get a Reaper Frog on average within
                                3 tries. He can easily carry until wave 40,
                                usually including the wave 40 boss. This makes
                                him a great unit to allow you to stack econ, and
                                slowly build the rest of your board. He also
                                applies 80 slow to enemies with his skill
                                "Suppression", which is overall a great skill to
                                have as it prevents stun leaks. For comparison,
                                the Mythic Guardian Coldy applies 50 slow with
                                her passive, and 50 slow with her skill, and
                                Penguin Musician applies 60 with his skill. So
                                Reaper Frog's 80 slow is one of the stronger
                                slows in the game.

                                Reaper Dian is a Magic Damage DPS Guardian. When
                                you get Reaper Frog, you can do the same curse
                                lift ability the standard frog has to transform
                                him into Reaper Dian. It has a 35% chance to
                                succeed by default, increasing to a 50% chance
                                to succeed at level 12. Overall, this means the
                                odds of succeeding in both transformations is
                                12.25% normally, and is raised to 17.5% at level
                                12. Or, 1 Reaper Dian every 8 regular Frogs 1
                                Reaper Dian per 6 regular Frogs at level 12.
                                Reaper Dian is a significant upgrade overall.
                                There have been videos of high level players
                                clearing Hell Mode with Reaper Dian as the only
                                DPS on the board. His skills and passives all
                                revolve around dealing massive damage.

                            <p>
                                Reaper Frog is the easiest to summon out of the
                                first 3 Immortal Guardians. To get a him, all
                                you need to do is turn a normal frog into a
                                Dian. Once you get a Dian, at any point you will
                                be able to convert it into a Reaper Frog. From
                                there, you can try to curse lift your Reaper
                                Frog, into his Reaper Dian Form.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                To get a Reaper Dian more easily, you can keep
                                making Dians from the normal Mythic Frog. When
                                you have both a Dian and a Reaper Frog on the
                                board, if you try to lift the curse on the Frog
                                and it fails, you can immediately turn your Dian
                                into a Reaper Frog. You can use this strategy to
                                make multiple attempts at Reaper Dian, without
                                having to give up having his base Frog Form if
                                you fail.

                                players and also particularly good for shorter
                                game modes (PvP, guild battle, underground cave,
                                daily dungeon) where Safe Box doesn't have time
                                to grow gold to a significant level. Even at
                                higher Safe Box levels, she is a really strong
                                Wave Clear and is always worth a summon.

                                Grand Mama is a Support Guardian that deals
                                Magic DMG. She's cheap to get on the board if
                                you can get Mythic Mama summoned before wave 10.
                                She's difficult to summon later in the game
                                though. She applies a variety of buffs and
                                debuffs through passives and skills:

                                    Revives a random Mythic unit every 5 Mythic
                                    deaths (ULT)

                                NOTE: The revival skill counts failed Frog Curse
                                Lifts, failed Chu Overclocks, and even Tar

                                In Hell Mode, she can go to wave 40, but she
                                will struggle to clear the wave 40 boss. Her
                                damage is comparable to Lazy Taoist/Overclocked
                                Rocket Chu.

                                Grand Mama shines particularly well in PvP. In
                                PvP, players don't typically get enough gold to
                                get large damage bonuses from Money Gun. With
                                Grand Mama level 6, you can get a minimum of
                                +225% damage from her passive bonus.

                            <p>
                                Assimilation is an interesting skill. On paper,
                                it sounds extremely powerful. In the right
                                circumstances (pvp) it is. But in coop, it won't
                                go as far as you think. This is because the
                                damage bonus for Assimilation only applies to a
                                characters base damage. This is different than
                                Money Gun, because Money Gun stacks with other
                                types of damage, like Mythic Damage Upgrade.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The short version is basically, after you reach
                                100k+ damage, less than 5% of your damage is
                                going to be coming from Grand Mama's damage
                                buff. However, in PvP players won't be getting
                                that much gold anyways. This means that a +225%
                                buff is going to be much more impactful. Since
                                it's not dwarfed by the typical Money Gun damage
                                buff.

                            <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                            <p>
                                To summon a Grand Mama, you need to have at
                                least 9 imps summoned by Mythic Mama. When you
                                get 9 imps or more, the button to summon Grand
                                Mama will show on screen. When pressed, she'll
                                be summoned and absorb all the imps. Each imp
                                will give a +10% ATK buff, unless she's level 6,
                                where she'll instead give a +25% ATK buff.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                This is a harder to accomplish in hell mode. The
                                increased health of Hell Mode enemies makes it
                                so that Mama's ult stops killing enemies much
                                earlier. If you don't get a Mama before wave 10,
                                you're likely going to have a hard time getting
                                9 imps. Even if you do, it's still going to take
                                luck to get them. For this reason, Grand Mama is
                                only really viable if you have Mama's exclusive
                                treasure.

                                Primeval Bomba is a Physical Damage DPS
                                guardian. There isn't a large direct commitment
                                to getting Primeval Bomba, as you only need
                                Bomba on the board to be able to get Primeval
                                Bomba. Attack speed buffs help get Primeval
                                Bomba more consistently, which is good because
                                it's a buff you want to build up anyway.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His Primeval Form has two main differences, the
                                basic attack, and the ultimate. The basic attack
                                does not have a workout effect to strengthen it,
                                instead, it just does 500% area damage at base,
                                meaning Primeval Bomba does not need to build up
                                stacks for full power.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                The other main difference is the ultimate
                                changes to cooldown-based instead of MP-based so
                                MP Regen effects stop working on it. Primeval
                                Bomba's ult also ignores some defense, which can
                                be important in the late game. If you're around
                                40 below the desired DR, Primeval Bomba will
                                still do major bonus damage in ultimate form.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                His main role is being a top tier Wave Clear
                                unit. Because his wave clear is so strong, this
                                frees you up to summon units who are really bad
                                at wave clear such as Watt or Vayne, without
                                worrying about if you can survive the waves.
                                You'll have good all around coverage for the
                                entire game if you take advantage of this, so
                                always make sure to pair him with a good boss
                                killer!
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Lance works as well, but keep in mind he takes a
                                melee space. Multiple Lances will end up
                                fighting for space with Bomba, so realistically
                                you'll only want 1 Lance next to your Bomba so
                                they can attack at the same time.

                            <p>
                                Primeval Bomba is summoned by Bomba having max
                                workout stacks, and then every basic attack has
                                a 0.1% chance for Primeval Bomba to be able to
                                be summoned. Workout stacks are given by chance
                                every basic attack Bomba does, this means
                                summoning Primeval Bomba is ALL about basic
                                attacks, so to speed up Primeval Bomba's
                                activation, you will want a lot of attack speed.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                A note for attack speeds, all attack speed buffs
                                become more effective the more UNIQUE sources of
                                attack speed there are. This means 2 eagles and
                                2 frogs is better than 6 eagles for example,
                                even though they both only technically give 30%
                                attack speed. So for maximum effectiveness, you
                                will want many different sources of attack speed
                                to speed up the Primeval Bomba process.

                                His passive is Critical Hit-based so there’s no
                                control over it. His Execution and Throw skills
                                have multipliers that are only slightly better
                                than Rocket Chu. His ult Guillotine sounds like
                                it is a boss killer move with its 50000%
                                Physical DMG on one target but Awakened Hailey’s
                                ult actually deals 112500% damage over its
                                entire duration and has splash.

                                unremarkable.

                                Sacrifice one Ninja with an 11-combo from
                                Assassinate and 4 additional Ninjas. Combos are
                                counted based on how many times Assassinate
                                reactivates (55% reactivation chance). Ninja’s
                                exclusive treasure Sharp Shuriken further
                                increases the reactivation chance of Assassinate
                                by up to 15%.
                            </p>

                                On paper, it seems like Shadow Ninja is really
                                easy to summon. You have to summon 5 Ninjas
                                anyway to sacrifice for the immortal form. The
                                cost of 5 Ninjas isn’t super expensive (5 epics,
                                10 rares). But in practice, the issue is having
                                enemies exist which can survive a 10-combo such
                                that your Ninjas can complete an 11-combo. As
                                such you have to juggle a fine balance between
                                too many Ninjas killing enemies too fast, your
                                teammate killing enemies too fast, and losing
                                the game due to not dealing enough damage.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                In Hard and God mode, you have the dungeon with
                                bosses where your Ninjas can attempt their
                                11-combos non-stop but this will compete for
                                spots with Bandits for gold farming.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Additionally, 5 Ninjas out of 18 spots on the
                                board is a lot of space taken up. Ninja is also
                                a Physical DPS and hence needs Defense Reduction
                                on top of the usual stun setup. This means that
                                attempting to summon Shadow Ninja only makes
                                more sense in Hard and God with the Dungeon to
                                have a better chance to get the 11-combo in time
                                and more space to fit all the 5 Ninjas and
                                Defense Reduction.

                                Chrono Ato is a very strong Physical Focused
                                Support. He increases your DEF Reduction by 50%,
                                allowing you to devote less of your board to DR.
                                He also increases physical DMG Ult DMG, and
                                reduces cooldown for guardians with cooldown
                                based ULTs. (Verdee, Chu, Immortal Bomba, Ninja)
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                He also slows enemies, so not only does he
                                increase damage but he helps your stun by
                                preventing leakage.

                                Often Ato ascends to Chrono Ato pretty late
                                game. This is okay, because the most notable
                                bonus from his immortal form is the +50% defense
                                reduction bonus. This works out pretty well
                                timing-wise because in general you don't need
                                high defense reduction numbers until very late
                                game anyways, like wave 65 or so.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                It's also worth considering that to even ascend
                                Ato, he needs to reduce friendly cooldowns by
                                100 seconds (see below) so your playstyle will
                                need to involve a solid amount of guardians with
                                cooldown based ults, not just mana based ults.

                                Top Vayne is a single target physical damage
                                boss killer. Vayne and Ato have a very strong
                                synergy overall, going both ways. If you play a
                                bunch of Vaynes, Ato will ascend to Chrono Ato
                                very quickly. If you play a bunch of Atos, Vayne
                                can stay in ult form much longer.

                                Mythic Vayne staying in ult form is the most
                                important thing. Since doing this now requires
                                Ato instead of Kitty Mage, Ato is required when
                                using Vayne as your boss killer. Unless you spam
                                Atos, you can't use Vayne to kill bosses the way
                                she was intended. However, there are some
                                benefits to this limitation.

                                Rocket Chu has always been one of the strongest
                                mythics in the entire game. This was before the
                                game had Ato buffing his damage and his
                                cooldown. Now that Ato is in the game, Chu can
                                ult constantly. Immortal Bomba is also much
                                stronger with Ato. Now, all these things are in
                                sync since they all benefit from Ato. While
                                Vayne can't reliably perma ult anymore, the
                                overall improved synergy makes using her easier.

                                Her Immortal Form is very strong. Unlike Vayne,
                                Top Vayne doesn't rely on tumbling. Her main
                                sources of damage at level 6 are Golden Arrow
                                and Rupture Arrow. Golden Arrow causes every 3rd
                                attack on the same target to do 7000% damage
                                (70x damage). Rupture Arrow triggers every 15
                                attacks, and causes a 5 second damage over time
                                effect. This DoT effect causes 3300% dmg every
                                half a second for those 5 seconds. This is the
                                equivalent of 33,000% dmg overall, or 330x
                                damage. Rupture Arrow also does an additional
                                10% damage for each point of the targets DEF
                                stat. In God Mode this would be an extra 1750%
                                damage every half second, or 17,500% over 5
                                seconds, an additional 175x damage. Adding both
                                together this would be 50,500%, or 505x damage.

                                As far as Arrow Explosion, I've seen
                                underwhelming results from this skill.
                                Considering every 3rd attack from Vayne does
                                7000% damage, Arrow Explosion only stacking
                                1000% damage per attack that can be triggered
                                later doesn't sound particularly impressive.
                                Especially considering how strong Rupture Arrow
                                is. Her ult does influence the viability here.
                                Her attack speed increases up to 150% when using
                                her Ult, and each attack stacks two explosive
                                arrows instead of one. Considering that Her ult
                                improves attack speed even more at level 12,
                                this could be a stronger ability then but
                                considering this also benefits Golden Arrow and
                                Rupture Arrow, it seems comparatively
                                underwhelming. This potential is also limited
                                behind a high amount of Ato spam. Theoretically,
                                the best strategy to maximize this ult would be
                                to only run a single Vayne, in hopes of spamming
                                even more Atos in place of other would-be
                                Vayne's.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                Overall, Vayne has a great immortal form. If you
                                don't see huge bursts of damage from Arrow
                                Explosion that's fine - Arrow Explosion appears
                                to be the less powerful abilities. Expect most
                                of your damage to come from Rupture Arrow and
                                Golden Arrow, these are your bread and butter.
                                Pursuing big Arrow Explosion results isn't the
                                reccommended approach, however, after every ult,
                                you should still trigger Arrow Explosion,
                                because of the increased Attack SPD and double
                                stacking, that's when the stacks will be at
                                their peak. Even then, the main damage will be
                                those other two skills, and you should expect
                                only a little extra damage from Arrow Explosion.
