          <h1>How to unlock Immortal Guardians</h1>
          <p>
            Immortal Guardians unlock when you get any Mythic Guardian to level
            15. After you unlock them, there will be a new section in the
            Guardian Tab
          </p>
          <div class="centered-imgs">
            <img
              src="../pics/screens/finding-immortal-tab.jpg"
              alt=""
              class="image-one"
            />
          </div>
          <p>
            To unlock an Immortal Guardian, you have to bring the mythic version
            of that Guardian up to level 15. After being unlocked, each immortal
            guardian has their own summon requirements in-game. NOTE: Only one
            copy of an Immortal can be summoned at a time. For Immortals with
            two forms like Reaper Frog, only one of those forms can be summoned
            at a time.
          </p>

          <h1>Leveling Up</h1>
          <div class="text-right-img-left">
            <p>
              Each immortal guardian has a different level separate from the
              level of their mythic form, and it starts at level 1. Note that
              they're typically still very strong at level 1, but the upgrades
              are notable increases in strength. Level 1 to level 6 is fairly
              easy to get, and is worth going for right after unlocking an
              Immortal. To level them up you need Immortal Stones instead of
              Mythic Stones. As of now, the only way to get Immortal Stones is
              through:

            <a href="guardian-upgrade-costs.html">here</a>
          </p>

          <h1>Immortals and Treasures</h1>
          <p>
            None of the Immortals are directly affected by Mythic Treasures.
            It's worth noting that the first 3 all do benefit from them on the
            way to summon them. The Mythic Frog's treasure gives some material
            back if a curse lift is failed. This means that it's easier to try
            again after each failed curse lift. Mama's treasure lets her summon
            imps more quickly. Hailey's treasure allows her to gather Star Power
            more quickly. All of these effects speed up their ability to turn
            into their immortal form, but once in the form they don't hold these
            treasures or benefit from any of the effects.
          </p>

          <h1>Immortals vs Night Shaman</h1>
          <p>
            In Hell and God Mode, there's a boss called Night Shaman that can
            change your Guardians into other Guardians. One of the best traits
            of Immortal Guardians is that they cannot be changed into another
            Guardian. This makes them even better than they would already be
            just being higher tier characters with more damage, because it gives
            your board some resilience.
          </p>

            Below is a list of all the different Immortal Guardians. It'll

            Frog Form
            <img

          <p>
            Reaper Frog is a Physical Damage DPS Guardian. He's easy to summon,
            and he does good damage. He has two forms: Frog Form, and Dian Form.
            Unlike the Mythic Frog Form, Immortal Reaper Frog is a very solid
            DPS unit. He has damage comparative to Lazy Taoist or Overclocked
            Rocket Chu. He's also much cheaper to summon than Rocket Chu, which
            is very good since they both have a chance to die when being
            summoned, meaning the risk is lower when summoning Reaper Frog,
            although Rocket Chu does have a higher success rate at 50% versus
            Frogs 35%.
          </p>
          <p>
            Reaper Frog's summon cost is low enough that at Luck Stone level 6+,
            he can somewhat consistently be summoned before wave 20 on Hell
            Mode. Since all you have to do is get a King Dian, you'll get a
            Reaper Frog on average within 3 tries. He can easily carry until
            wave 40, usually including the wave 40 boss. This makes him a great
            unit to allow you to stack econ, and slowly build the rest of your
            board. He also applies 80 slow to enemies with his skill
            "Suppression", which is overall a great skill to have as it prevents
            stun leaks. For comparison, the Mythic Guardian Coldy applies 50
            slow with her passive, and 50 slow with her skill, and Penguin
            Musician applies 60 with his skill. So Reaper Frog's 80 slow is one
            of the stronger slows in the game.

            Reaper Dian is a Magic Damage DPS Guardian. When you get Reaper
            Frog, you can do the same curse lift ability the standard frog has
            to transform him into Reaper Dian. It has a 35% chance to succeed by
            default, increasing to a 50% chance to succeed at level 12. Overall,
            this means the odds of succeeding in both transformations is 12.25%
            normally, and is raised to 17.5% at level 12. Or, 1 Reaper Dian
            every 8 regular Frogs 1 Reaper Dian per 6 regular Frogs at level 12.
            Reaper Dian is a significant upgrade overall. There have been videos
            of high level players clearing Hell Mode with Reaper Dian as the
            only DPS on the board. His skills and passives all revolve around
            dealing massive damage.

          <h2>How to Summon</h2>
          <p>
            Reaper Frog is the easiest to summon out of the first 3 Immortal
            Guardians. To get a him, all you need to do is turn a normal frog
            into a Dian. Once you get a Dian, at any point you will be able to
            convert it into a Reaper Frog. From there, you can try to curse lift
            your Reaper Frog, into his Reaper Dian Form.
          </p>
          <p>
            To get a Reaper Dian more easily, you can keep making Dians from the
            normal Mythic Frog. When you have both a Dian and a Reaper Frog on
            the board, if you try to lift the curse on the Frog and it fails,
            you can immediately turn your Dian into a Reaper Frog. You can use
            this strategy to make multiple attempts at Reaper Dian, without
            having to give up having his base Frog Form if you fail.

          <h2>Playstyle</h2>
          <p>
            Grand Mama is a Support Guardian that deals Magic DMG. She's cheap
            to get on the board if you can get Mythic Mama summoned before wave
            10. She's difficult to summon later in the game though. She applies
            a variety of buffs and debuffs through passives and skills:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>+225% or higher damage to the whole board (passive)</li>
            <li>Increases DMG taken by 15% (skill)</li>
            <li>Reduces healing by 50% (skill)</li>
            <li>Revives a random Mythic unit every 5 Mythic deaths (ULT)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            NOTE: The revival skill counts failed Frog Curse Lifts, failed Chu
            Overclocks, and even Tar Cannibalisms. At level 12, this skill
            triggers on every 3 deaths instead of 5.
          </p>
          <p>
            In Hell Mode, she can go to wave 40, but she will struggle to clear
            the wave 40 boss. Her damage is comparable to Lazy
            Taoist/Overclocked Rocket Chu.
          </p>
          <p>
            Grand Mama shines particularly well in PvP. In PvP, players don't
            typically get enough gold to get large damage bonuses from Money
            Gun. With Grand Mama level 6, you can get a minimum of +225% damage
            from her passive bonus.

          </p>
          <h2>Assimilation Details</h2>
          <p>
            Assimilation is an interesting skill. On paper, it sounds extremely
            powerful. In the right circumstances (pvp) it is. But in coop, it
            won't go as far as you think. This is because the damage bonus for
            Assimilation only applies to a characters base damage. This is
            different than Money Gun, because Money Gun stacks with other types
            of damage, like Mythic Damage Upgrade.
          </p>
          <p>
            The short version is basically, after you reach 100k+ damage, less
            than 5% of your damage is going to be coming from Grand Mama's
            damage buff. However, in PvP players won't be getting that much gold
            anyways. This means that a +225% buff is going to be much more
            impactful. Since it's not dwarfed by the typical Money Gun damage
            buff.
          </p>
          <h2>How to Summon</h2>
          <p>
            To summon a Grand Mama, you need to have at least 9 imps summoned by
            Mythic Mama. When you get 9 imps or more, the button to summon Grand
            Mama will show on screen. When pressed, she'll be summoned and
            absorb all the imps. Each imp will give a +10% ATK buff, unless
            she's level 6, where she'll instead give a +25% ATK buff.
          </p>

            This is a harder to accomplish in hell mode. The increased health of
            Hell Mode enemies makes it so that Mama's ult stops killing enemies
            much earlier. If you don't get a Mama before wave 10, you're likely
            going to have a hard time getting 9 imps. Even if you do, it's still
            going to take luck to get them. For this reason, Grand Mama is only
            really viable if you have Mama's exclusive treasure.

                    <p>
                        Primeval Bomba is a Physical Damage DPS guardian. There isn't a large direct commitment to getting Primeval Bomba, as you only need Bomba on the board to be able to get Primeval Bomba. If you're using attack speed buffs to help get Primeval Bomba more consistently, that is a buff you generally want to build up anyway.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Primeval Bomba is very similar to Bomba, with two main differences, the basic attack, and the ultimate. The basic attack does not have a workout effect to strengthen it, instead, it just does 500% area damage at base, meaning Primeval Bomba does not need to build up stacks for full power.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The other main difference is the ultimate changes to cooldown-based instead of MP-based so MP Regen effects stop working on it. The attack and attack speed buffs multiply on overall output and hence are functionally similar but the immortal ult also ignores some defense, which can be important in the late game. If you're around 40 below the desired DR, Primeval Bomba will still do major bonus damage in ultimate form.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Primeval Bomba does a lot more mob damage than boss damage, making them work with guardians that do boss damage such as Lance, Watt, or Vayne a very good combination, keep this in mind while going for Primeval Bomba.
                    </p>

                    <h2>How to Summon</h2>
                    <p>
                        Primeval Bomba is summoned by Bomba having max workout stacks, and then every basic attack has a 0.1% chance for Primeval Bomba to be able to be summoned. Workout stacks are given by chance every basic attack Bomba does, this means summoning Primeval Bomba is ALL about basic attacks, so to speed up Primeval Bomba's activation, you will want a lot of attack speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        A note for attack speeds, all attack speed buffs become more effective the more UNIQUE sources of attack speed there are. This means 2 eagles and 2 frogs is better than 6 eagles for example, even though they both only technically give 30% attack speed. So for maximum effectiveness, you will want many different sources of attack speed to speed up the Primeval Bomba process.
                    </p>
