                An Immortal Guardian unlocks when you get their mythic form to
                level 15. Once the mythic form is level 15, you can pay 6000
                gems to unlock the immortal form. The actual "Immortal" tab to
                view Immortal Guardians unlocks once you get any mythic to level
                12.

                After being unlocked, each immortal guardian has their own
                summon requirements in-game. NOTE: Only one copy of an Immortal
                can be summoned at a time. For Immortals with two forms like
                Reaper Frog, only one of those forms can be summoned at a time.

                  Each immortal guardian has a different level separate from the
                  level of their mythic form, and it starts at level 1. Note
                  that they're typically still very strong at level 1, but the
                  upgrades are notable increases in strength. Level 1 to level 6
                  is fairly easy to get, and is worth going for right after
                  unlocking an Immortal. To level them up you need Immortal
                  Stones instead of Mythic Stones. As of now, the only way to
                  get Immortal Stones is through:

                None of the Immortals are directly affected by Mythic Treasures.
                It's worth noting that the first 3 all do benefit from them on
                the way to summon them. The Mythic Frog's treasure gives some
                material back if a curse lift is failed. This means that it's
                easier to try again after each failed curse lift. Mama's
                treasure lets her summon imps more quickly. Hailey's treasure
                allows her to gather Star Power more quickly. All of these
                effects speed up their ability to turn into their immortal form,
                but once in the form they don't hold these treasures or benefit
                from any of the effects.

                In Hell and God Mode, there's a boss called Night Shaman that
                can change your Guardians into other Guardians. One of the best
                traits of Immortal Guardians is that they cannot be changed into
                another Guardian. This makes them even better than they would
                already be just being higher tier characters with more damage,
                because it gives your board some resilience.

              <p>
                Reaper Frog is a Physical Damage DPS Guardian. He's easy to
                summon, and he does good damage. He has two forms: Frog Form,
                and Dian Form. Unlike the Mythic Frog Form, Immortal Reaper Frog
                is a very solid DPS unit. He has damage comparative to Lazy
                Taoist or Overclocked Rocket Chu. He's also much cheaper to
                summon than Rocket Chu, which is very good since they both have
                a chance to die when being summoned, meaning the risk is lower
                when summoning Reaper Frog, although Rocket Chu does have a
                higher success rate at 50% versus Frogs 35%.
              </p>
              <p>
                Reaper Frog's summon cost is low enough that at Luck Stone level
                6+, he can somewhat consistently be summoned before wave 20 on
                Hell Mode. Since all you have to do is get a King Dian, you'll
                get a Reaper Frog on average within 3 tries. He can easily carry
                until wave 40, usually including the wave 40 boss. This makes
                him a great unit to allow you to stack econ, and slowly build
                the rest of your board. He also applies 80 slow to enemies with
                his skill "Suppression", which is overall a great skill to have
                as it prevents stun leaks. For comparison, the Mythic Guardian
                Coldy applies 50 slow with her passive, and 50 slow with her
                skill, and Penguin Musician applies 60 with his skill. So Reaper
                Frog's 80 slow is one of the stronger slows in the game.

                Reaper Dian is a Magic Damage DPS Guardian. When you get Reaper
                Frog, you can do the same curse lift ability the standard frog
                has to transform him into Reaper Dian. It has a 35% chance to
                succeed by default, increasing to a 50% chance to succeed at
                level 12. Overall, this means the odds of succeeding in both
                transformations is 12.25% normally, and is raised to 17.5% at
                level 12. Or, 1 Reaper Dian every 8 regular Frogs 1 Reaper Dian
                per 6 regular Frogs at level 12. Reaper Dian is a significant
                upgrade overall. There have been videos of high level players
                clearing Hell Mode with Reaper Dian as the only DPS on the
                board. His skills and passives all revolve around dealing
                massive damage.

              <h2>How to Summon</h2>
              <p>
                Reaper Frog is the easiest to summon out of the first 3 Immortal
                Guardians. To get a him, all you need to do is turn a normal
                frog into a Dian. Once you get a Dian, at any point you will be
                able to convert it into a Reaper Frog. From there, you can try
                to curse lift your Reaper Frog, into his Reaper Dian Form.
              </p>
              <p>
                To get a Reaper Dian more easily, you can keep making Dians from
                the normal Mythic Frog. When you have both a Dian and a Reaper
                Frog on the board, if you try to lift the curse on the Frog and
                it fails, you can immediately turn your Dian into a Reaper Frog.
                You can use this strategy to make multiple attempts at Reaper
                Dian, without having to give up having his base Frog Form if you
                fail.

              <p>
                Awakened Hailey is a Magical Damage DPS guardian. Her immortal
                form continues the style of her Mythic form in having a large
                ATK boost. To compare the ATK boost she gets from her skills,
                you'd need this much gold to get the same bonus from Money Gun:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>285k gold at Money Gun 1</li>
                <li>259k gold at Money Gun 2</li>
                <li>238k gold at Money Gun 3</li>
                <li>219k gold at Money Gun 4</li>
                <li>204k gold at Money Gun 5</li>
                <li>190k gold at Money Gun 6</li>
                <li>178k gold at Money Gun 7</li>
                <li>168k gold at Money Gun 8</li>
                <li>158k gold at Money Gun 9</li>
                <li>150k gold at Money Gun 10</li>
                <li>140k gold at Money Gun 11</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                This makes her especially good for lower sb/mg players and also
                particularly good for shorter game modes (PvP, guild battle,
                underground cave, daily dungeon) where Safe Box doesn't have
                time to grow gold to a significant level. Even at higher Safe
                Box levels, she is a really strong Wave Clear and is always
                worth a summon.

              <p>
                Grand Mama is a Support Guardian that deals Magic DMG. She's
                cheap to get on the board if you can get Mythic Mama summoned
                before wave 10. She's difficult to summon later in the game
                though. She applies a variety of buffs and debuffs through
                passives and skills:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>+225% or higher damage to the whole board (passive)</li>
                <li>Increases DMG taken by 15% (skill)</li>
                <li>Reduces healing by 50% (skill)</li>
                <li>
                  Revives a random Mythic unit every 5 Mythic deaths (ULT)
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                NOTE: The revival skill counts failed Frog Curse Lifts, failed
                Chu Overclocks, and even Tar Cannibalisms. At level 12, this
                skill triggers on every 3 deaths instead of 5.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Hell Mode, she can go to wave 40, but she will struggle to
                clear the wave 40 boss. Her damage is comparable to Lazy
                Taoist/Overclocked Rocket Chu.
              </p>
              <p>
                Grand Mama shines particularly well in PvP. In PvP, players
                don't typically get enough gold to get large damage bonuses from
                Money Gun. With Grand Mama level 6, you can get a minimum of
                +225% damage from her passive bonus.

              </p>
              <h2>Assimilation Details</h2>
              <p>
                Assimilation is an interesting skill. On paper, it sounds
                extremely powerful. In the right circumstances (pvp) it is. But
                in coop, it won't go as far as you think. This is because the
                damage bonus for Assimilation only applies to a characters base
                damage. This is different than Money Gun, because Money Gun
                stacks with other types of damage, like Mythic Damage Upgrade.
              </p>
              <p>
                The short version is basically, after you reach 100k+ damage,
                less than 5% of your damage is going to be coming from Grand
                Mama's damage buff. However, in PvP players won't be getting
                that much gold anyways. This means that a +225% buff is going to
                be much more impactful. Since it's not dwarfed by the typical
                Money Gun damage buff.
              </p>
              <h2>How to Summon</h2>
              <p>
                To summon a Grand Mama, you need to have at least 9 imps
                summoned by Mythic Mama. When you get 9 imps or more, the button
                to summon Grand Mama will show on screen. When pressed, she'll
                be summoned and absorb all the imps. Each imp will give a +10%
                ATK buff, unless she's level 6, where she'll instead give a +25%
                ATK buff.
              </p>
              <p>
                This is a harder to accomplish in hell mode. The increased
                health of Hell Mode enemies makes it so that Mama's ult stops
                killing enemies much earlier. If you don't get a Mama before
                wave 10, you're likely going to have a hard time getting 9 imps.
                Even if you do, it's still going to take luck to get them. For
                this reason, Grand Mama is only really viable if you have Mama's
                exclusive treasure.

              <h2>Playstyle</h2>
              <p>
                Primeval Bomba is a Physical Damage DPS guardian. There isn't a
                large direct commitment to getting Primeval Bomba, as you only
                need Bomba on the board to be able to get Primeval Bomba. Attack
                speed buffs help get Primeval Bomba more consistently, which is
                good because it's a buff you want to build up anyway.
              </p>
              <p>
                His Primeval Form has two main differences, the basic attack,
                and the ultimate. The basic attack does not have a workout
                effect to strengthen it, instead, it just does 500% area damage
                at base, meaning Primeval Bomba does not need to build up stacks
                for full power.
              </p>
              <p>
                The other main difference is the ultimate changes to
                cooldown-based instead of MP-based so MP Regen effects stop
                working on it. Primeval Bomba's ult also ignores some defense,
                which can be important in the late game. If you're around 40
                below the desired DR, Primeval Bomba will still do major bonus
                damage in ultimate form.
              </p>
              <p>
                His main role is being a top tier Wave Clear unit. Because his
                wave clear is so strong, this frees you up to summon units who
                are really bad at wave clear such as Watt or Vayne, without
                worrying about if you can survive the waves. You'll have good
                all around coverage for the entire game if you take advantage of
                this, so always make sure to pair him with a good boss killer!
              </p>
              <p>
                Lance works as well, but keep in mind he takes a melee space.
                Multiple Lances will end up fighting for space with Bomba, so
                realistically you'll only want 1 Lance next to your Bomba so
                they can attack at the same time.

              <h2>How to Summon</h2>
              <p>
                Primeval Bomba is summoned by Bomba having max workout stacks,
                and then every basic attack has a 0.1% chance for Primeval Bomba
                to be able to be summoned. Workout stacks are given by chance
                every basic attack Bomba does, this means summoning Primeval
                Bomba is ALL about basic attacks, so to speed up Primeval
                Bomba's activation, you will want a lot of attack speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                A note for attack speeds, all attack speed buffs become more
                effective the more UNIQUE sources of attack speed there are.
                This means 2 eagles and 2 frogs is better than 6 eagles for
                example, even though they both only technically give 30% attack
                speed. So for maximum effectiveness, you will want many
                different sources of attack speed to speed up the Primeval Bomba
                process.
              </p>

              <h2>Playstyle</h2>
              <p>Ghost Ninja is a Physical Damage DPS guardian.</p>
              <p>
                His base ATK is the lowest of the DPS Immortals. His passive is
                Critical Hit-based so there’s no control over it. His Execution
                and Throw skills have multipliers that are only slightly better
                than Rocket Chu. His ult Guillotine sounds like it is a boss
                killer move with its 50000% Physical DMG on one target but
                Awakened Hailey’s ult actually deals 112500% damage over its
                entire duration and has splash.
              </p>
              <p>In conclusion, Ghost Ninja is rather unremarkable.</p>

              <h2>How to Summon</h2>
              <p>
                Sacrifice one Ninja with an 11-combo from Assassinate and 4
                additional Ninjas. Combos are counted based on how many times
                Assassinate reactivates (55% reactivation chance). Ninja’s
                exclusive treasure Sharp Shuriken further increases the
                reactivation chance of Assassinate by up to 15%.
              </p>
              <p>
                On paper, it seems like Shadow Ninja is really easy to summon.
                You have to summon 5 Ninjas anyway to sacrifice for the immortal
                form. The cost of 5 Ninjas isn’t super expensive (5 epics, 10
                rares). But in practice, the issue is having enemies exist which
                can survive a 10-combo such that your Ninjas can complete an
                11-combo. As such you have to juggle a fine balance between too
                many Ninjas killing enemies too fast, your teammate killing
                enemies too fast, and losing the game due to not dealing enough
                damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                In Hard and God mode, you have the dungeon with bosses where
                your Ninjas can attempt their 11-combos non-stop but this will
                compete for spots with Bandits for gold farming.
              </p>
              <p>
                Additionally 5 Ninjas out of 18 spots on the board is a lot of
                space taken up. Ninja is also a Physical DPS and hence needs
                Defense Reduction on top of the usual stun setup. This means
                that attempting to summon Shadow Ninja only makes more sense in
                Hard and God with the Dungeon to have a better chance to get the
                11-combo in time and more space to fit all the 5 Ninjas and
                Defense Reduction.
