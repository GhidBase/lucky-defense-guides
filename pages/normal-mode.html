                Follow this guide and you will be able to carry normal mode even
                at extremely low levels. It goes through the process of clearing
                normal mode from the opening waves, how to play the mid-game,
                and how to scale your damage to the very end. Read this and you
                will be able to win even if your partner has no thumbs.

                You need to start the match by stacking luck stones and coins
                from missions. You’ll want to have the artifact item “luck
                stone” to do this because every mission you complete after you
                get it will give you a luck stone on top of the normal reward
                for completing that mission. Your goal is to do Epic Roulette
                Summon to get one or two epics units on the board so you can
                easily kill the hunts before wave 10.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most reliable way to get luck stones fast is to complete
                these missions:
              </p>
              <div class="center-imgs">
                <img src="../pics/missions/collect-all-commons.png" alt="" />

                <img src="../pics/missions/defeat-monsters.png" alt="" />
              </div>
              <p>
                If you have the Luck Stone artifact you’ll have gained +400
                coins and +4 luck stones from those missions. If you merged
                commons and sold blues, thats an extra +1 or +2 luck stones on
                top of that. It’s highly recommended to not merge your bandits
                because they help generate coins, but if you haven't gotten
                bandits to level 6 yet, they generate 5x less coins and you
                could probably get away with merging and selling them to do
                another Epic Roulette Summon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you get an epic, it’ll easily kill your hunts and bosses. 2
                killed hunts gives you +4 more luck stones, and killing your
                hunt before wave 10 gives you +100 coins and another luck stone
                because of another mission. You’re going to need to save coins
                for the next part of the strategy anyways, so after completing
                all those missions you should try to save 1000 coins. This
                completes another mission, giving you another +50 coins, and
                another luck stone.

                luck stones on Epic Roulette Summon, you’ll average 3 to 4 epics

              <p>
                The next step in securing a win is rushing to get a strong DPS
                mythic. There’s a trick to this that allows you to get the odds
                of success really high – you need to summon a legendary guardian
                as fast as possible. There’s a really good reason for this.
                Legendary units themselves aren’t that strong. However, there
                are only 4 legendary units in the game, and every single one of
                them turns into a unit that can either solo, or almost solo
                normal mode, even if you only have safebox and moneygun 1. If it
                can’t solo it, you just need to spawn one more legendary unit
                and get a second mythic guardian.
              </p>

              <p>Once you get a legendary, convert it like this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>War Machine - Use it to summon Rocket Chu</li>
                <li>Storm Elemental - Lazy Taoist</li>
                <li>Sheriff - Verdee</li>
                <li>Tiger - Batman or Master Kun</li>
              </ul>

              <p>There is a catch to some of these units though:</p>

                <div class="center-container">
                  <img
                    src="../pics/wave-clears/Chu.png"
                    alt="Rocket Chu"
                    class="img-40-mobile-20-desktop"

              <div class="center-container"><h2>Rocket Chu</h2></div>
              <p>
                Rocket Chu has an ult that lets you transform him into a way
                stronger version. But there’s a chance he’ll fail and explode
                when you try to transform him. His success chance is 35% at
                level 1, and gets as high as 50% at level 6, so it’s extremely
                worth the upgrade.
              </p>
              <p>
                <div class="center-container">
                  <img

              <div class="center-container"><h2>Verdee</h2></div>
              <p>
                Verdee is pretty strong, but her main attack (other than her
                ult) takes 10 seconds before it explodes, so you need to have
                plenty of stun for her to work. You should always have stun
                anyway though, so this isn’t such a big deal.

              </p>
              <div class="center-container"><h2>Batman</h2></div>
              <p>
                Batman is really strong, but his ability that makes him strong
                requires you to spend coins to upgrade him. This is very worth
                it, and +10 is a safe level to get him to. But coins are your
                main source of damage buff, so this is a big loss of damage. For
                this reason, it’s worth considering getting Master Kun instead.
                Master
              </p>
              <p>
                <div class="center-container">
                  <img
                    src="../pics/wave-clears/Kun.png"
                    alt="Kun"
                    class="img-40-mobile-20-desktop"
                  />
                </div>
              </p>
              <div class="center-container"><h2>Master Kun</h2></div>
              <p>
                Kun has a similar ability. Instead of upgrading +1 at a time in
                exchange for coins, he only upgrades when his ult is charged.
                When you use his ult, it gives him a random upgrade. If you get
                a weak upgrade, you’re going to have to wait for his ult to
                recharge. But since you can hold onto more coins, this is an
                upgrade in damage that’s worth it long term.
              </p>
              <p>
                <div class="center-container">
                  <img

              <div class="center-container"><h2>Lazy Taoist</h2></div>
              <p>
                The biggest catch is Lazy Taoist. Lazy Taoist is an iconic
                guardian because he’s very strong. He’s arguably the strongest
                unit in the game. Similar to Verdee, his attacks are very slow
                and rely on you having a lot of stun. But his truly unique trait
                is that he’s extremely weak until he’s level 12, where he’s much
                stronger, and attacks twice as fast. Before level 12 you’re
                going to have lackluster results with him, but there’s
                unfortunately not a better option if you do get storm elemental,
                so he’s still worth a summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the best results, you’ll want Rocket Chu, Verdee, Master
                Kun, and Lazy Taoist to all be level 6. Past that, check out the
                separate guide on mythic unlock/upgrade order.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lastly, you will get more legendaries doing epic gamble than you
                will doing legendary gamble. The conversion from luck stone to
                legendary is actually cheaper doing epic gamble than it is
                legendary gamble. So not only will epics keep you alive until
                you get one, but you’ll get legendaries more frequently this way
                as well.
