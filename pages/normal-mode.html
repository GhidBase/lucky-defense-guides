                mode from start to finish. From the opening waves, how to play
                the mid-game, and how to scale your damage to the very end. It
                doesn't matter who your partner is. If you follow this guide,
                you'll be able to carry the team through.

              <p>
                You need to start the match by stacking luck stones and coins
                from missions. You’ll want to have the artifact item “luck
                stone” to do this because every mission you complete after you
                get it will give you a luck stone on top of the normal reward
                for completing that mission. Your goal is to do Epic Roulette
                Summon to get one or two epics units on the board so you can
                easily kill the hunts before wave 10.
              </p>
              <p>
                The most reliable way to get luck stones fast is to complete
                these missions:
              </p>

                <img src="../pics/missions/defeat-monsters.png" alt="" />
              </div>
              <p>
                If you have the Luck Stone artifact you’ll have gained +400
                coins and +4 luck stones from those missions. If you merged
                commons and sold blues, thats an extra +1 or +2 luck stones on
                top of that. It’s highly recommended to not merge your bandits
                because they help generate coins, but if you haven't gotten
                bandits to level 6 yet, they generate 5x less coins and you
                could probably get away with merging and selling them to do
                another Epic Roulette Summon.
              </p>

              <p>
                Once you get an epic, it’ll easily kill your hunts and bosses. 2
                killed hunts gives you +4 more luck stones, and killing your
                hunt before wave 10 gives you +100 coins and another luck stone
                because of another mission. You’re going to need to save coins
                for the next part of the strategy anyways, so after completing
                all those missions you should try to save 1000 coins. This
                completes another mission, giving you another +50 coins, and
                another luck stone.

                The next step in securing a win is rushing to get a strong DPS
                mythic. There’s a trick to this that allows you to get the odds
                of success really high – you need to summon a legendary guardian
                as fast as possible. There’s a really good reason for this.
                Legendary units themselves aren’t that strong. However, there
                are only 4 legendary units in the game, and every single one of
                them turns into a unit that can either solo, or almost solo
                normal mode, even if you only have safebox and moneygun 1. If it
                can’t solo it, you just need to spawn one more legendary unit
                and get a second mythic guardian.
              </p>

              <p>Once you get a legendary, convert it like this:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>War Machine - Use it to summon Rocket Chu</li>
                <li>
                  Storm Elemental - Lazy Taoist (only much later, see
                  <a href="unlock-order.html">Mythic Unlock Order for Hard</a>)
                </li>
                <li>Sheriff - Hailey</li>
                <li>Tiger - Master Kun</li>
              </ul>

              <p>There is a catch to some of these units though:</p>

              <p>
                Rocket Chu has an ult that lets you transform him into a way
                stronger version. But there’s a chance he’ll fail and explode
                when you try to transform him. His success chance is 35% at
                level 1, and gets as high as 50% at level 6, so it’s extremely
                worth the upgrade.

                Hailey is really strong, but her Star Power ability that makes
                her strong requires you to spend coins on summoning. You have to
                be careful not to spend too much coins summoning to upgrade her
                Star Power or you will ruin your coin economy. Try to postpone
                summoning to upgrade her Star Power for later waves when she
                needs the power boost so that you have a bigger coin pool to
                absorb the impact of summoning.

                Master Kun has a similar ability. Instead of upgrading +1 at a
                time in exchange for coins, he only upgrades when his ult is
                charged. When you use his ult, it gives him a random upgrade. If
                you get a weak upgrade, you’re going to have to wait for his ult
                to recharge. But since you can hold onto more coins, this is an
                upgrade in damage that’s worth it long term.

              <p>
                The biggest catch is Lazy Taoist. Lazy Taoist is an iconic
                guardian because he’s very strong. He’s arguably the strongest
                unit in the game.His attacks are very slow and rely on you
                having a lot of stun. But his truly unique trait is that he’s
                extremely weak until he’s level 12, where he’s much stronger,
                and attacks twice as fast. Before level 12 you’re going to have
                lackluster results with him, but there’s unfortunately not a
                better option if you do get storm elemental, so he’s still worth
                a summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                For the best results, you’ll want Rocket Chu, Master Kun, and
                Hailey to all be level 6. Past that, check out the separate
                guide on mythic unlock/upgrade order.

                Lastly, you will get more legendaries doing epic gamble than you
                will doing legendary gamble. The conversion from luck stone to
                legendary is actually cheaper doing epic gamble than it is
                legendary gamble. So not only will epics keep you alive until
                you get one, but you’ll get legendaries more frequently this way
                as well.

                After merging those legendaries, you now have a mythic dps.
                Hopefully it wasn’t Taoist, and you’re in the clear. (this is
                why Tao 12 so good, other than the fact he's probably the
                strongest character in the game at level 12+) Even if it Tao,
                you need to shift your focus to setting up stuns. This section
                will be short. The jist of it is, if you stun all the enemies so
                they’re locked into one place, every attack you perform will hit
                every single enemy at one time. If you do this, you only need
                one or two dps mythics to clear normal. If you don’t have enough
                stun, and they’re just walking in a single file line, you’re
                only going to be able to hit some of them as they walk past, and
                you’re just not going to kill them. You could have 5 dps
                mythics, and you’ll probably still lose. 1 dps with enough stun
                to lock enemies in place will outdamage 5 dps mythics every
                time.

              <p>
                All you need to get results like that is 1 stack of purple stun
                robots and 2 stacks of blue stun robots, and you're set.

                If you’re using physical damage units, they need defense

                As you get to the higher waves, enemies start to have more

                If you have high defense reduction, physical damage actually
                gets a buff of up to +90% damage, roughly 2x the damage. Here's
                an example of a 70% damage buff.

                normal damage.

                Hands down the biggest damage buff you’ll ever get in the game
                is through stacking coins with Safe Box, and using those saved
                coins to boost your damage with Money Gun. Nothing even comes
                close to this.

              <p>
                We don't have the specific formula on how much damage Money Gun
                adds to damage yet. However, it becomes very clear once you
                start getting 100k+ gold, that it increases damage by a massive
                amount. If we assume the damage is a specifically "0.91% x each
                gold coins held" It would translate like this -
              </p>
              <p>100k gold x .91% = 910% damage</p>
              <p>
                How can you get 100k gold? Even with safebox 1 you can get a lot
                of gold. I got 80k on the last game I played on an alt account
                with Safe Box 1. The idea is - do the missions at the start of
                the game, get your epics, and then do everything in your power
                to summon as little as possible for the rest of the game. Need
                stuns? Do Rare Roulette Summon until you get blue stun robots.
                Need epics or legendaries? Do Epic Roulette Summon. If you need
                a common to summon a DPS Mythic, it can be worth summoning to
                get it, but if it’s early and you can survive off just your
                epics, wait a little bit so that your coins have time to build
                more interest. If you don't
                <b>NEED</b> to spend gold to summon somehting, and you'll stay
                alive, you shouldn't be spending gold. By the later waves, you
                should be able to be making 1000-5000 coins per wave just from
                safebox alone, not including the rest of the coins from killing
                monsters.

                Many mechanics are very difficult to actually measure. Luckily,
                this upgrade is the easiest to understand upgrade in the game.
                The mythic damage upgrade costs 2 luck stones at the start.
                Every time you do it the cost goes up by one luck stone and you
                get an extra +50% damage.
                <br /><br />The way this is calculated is:
              </p>
              <p>(all your other damage buffs/debuffs) * (1 + .5 * Upgrades)</p>
              <p>I'll translate this into easier to read percent bonuses:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>2 upgrades = +100%</li>
                <li>4 = +200%</li>
                <li>8 = +400%</li>
                <li>16 = +800%</li>
                <li>31 (max) = +1550%</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Or you can read them in the terms of "how much does each upgrade
                multiply my damage" as well:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>2 upgrades = 2x damage</li>
                <li>4 = 3x damage</li>
                <li>8 = 5x damage</li>
                <li>16 = 9x damage</li>
                <li>31 (max) = (almost) 17x damage</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Keep this upgrade in mind. Early on, do your epic gambles and
                get some dps. You don't need these damage bonuses early on.
                Upgrade mythic damage throughout the game. If at some point you
                really want to upgrade mythic damage heavily, towards the end
                when you’re making a ton of money from safe box you can max out
                your summon chance, spam summon, and sell a bunch of guardians
                and you can use the luck stones from that to upgrade even
                further.

                If you use these things, you can carry normal mode even at low

                safe box or money gun. Some players are unlucky with keys at the
                start. To help with this, I recommend you join the discord.
                There’s a channel called “first-clear-help” that has players
                willing to help you through hard mode, and sometimes hell mode,
                to get your first clear rewards. This will help you not only get
                more keys to try and get safe box and money gun, but it will
                also get you mythic stones, helping you level your mythics.

              /></b>
              <p>
                Hailey is the first mythic to get as she has the highest ATK
                boost of the mythics from her skills which makes her especially
                useful when your sb/mg is low since you are not yet able to
                multiply your ATK to sky high levels yet. She requires a Sheriff
                (legendary), a Hunter (epic) and a Sandman (rare) to summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Her ATK gets boosted by her Star Power passive skill which has a
                chance to increase Star Power (max 10) each time you summon a
                unit. Be careful not to destroy your gold economy when
                increasing her Star Power. It is recommended to postpone
                upgrading her Star Power as late as possible to give Safe Box
                more time to grow your existing gold or when you need common
                guardians for merging other mythics. Due to her ATK boost, she
                will also be useful for shorter game modes like guild battle and
                underground cave.
              </p>
              <p>
                Upgrading her to level 6 doubles the ATK boost from her Star
                Power passive skill which gives you a lot more leeway to learn
                how to manage your gold economy to boost the ATK of the rest of
                your board.

              <p>
                Master Kun aka Kun is the second mythic to get. Similarly to
                Hailey, he has a strong ATK boost from his skills though his
                comes from his ult, Endure Rage. Endure Rage gives a random ATK
                boost (indicated by a +1 to +99 with the higher number giving a
                higher ATK boost). Each time you use Endure Rage, the number
                will be randomly chosen between 1 to 99. So you can have your
                ATK boost decrease if you’re unlucky on subsequent uses of
                Endure Rage. He requires a Tiger Master (legendary), an Eagle
                (epic) and a Paladin (rare) to summon.Due to his ATK boost, Kun
                is useful for shorter game modes like guild battle and
                underground cave.
              </p>
              <p>
                At level 6, Kun unlocks a passive ult which generates more
                spinning flames based on his stacks of Endure Rage (additional
                flame every 30 stacks) which increases his damage output
                significantly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Kun’s primary shortcoming is that his damage output will fail to
                keep up with other mythics who benefit fully from sb/mg ATK
                boosting. Because a big part of his damage comes from his ult’s
                ATK boost which doesn’t interact with sb/mg, he will start being
                ineffective from Hard wave 50 onwards and equally Hell wave 50
                onwards. Hailey has this issue to a much less extent since her
                ATK boost is much higher and she has an immortal form to upgrade
                to.

              <p>
                Rocket Chu aka Chu is the third mythic to get. Chu has an
                Overclock ability to become the stronger version. When people
                talk about using Chu, it is always referring to the Overclocked
                version. At level 1, the Overclock success rate is 35%. At level
                6, this increases to 50% which greatly increases the consistency
                of Chu. Chu requires a War Machine (legendary), a Shock Robot
                (rare) and a Thrower (common) to summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Timing when to use Overclock can be tricky. If you fail, Chu
                explodes but deals a ton of damage to enemies within range.
                Hence, it is recommended to Overclock Chu during boss waves in
                the first half of the game (ie. W40 and earlier) to help take
                out the bosses even in the case of failure. Past W40, just
                Overclock Chu as fast as possible since the explosion damage
                will be less significant on bosses. There isn’t a point to keep
                Chu non-Overclocked as it is a lot weaker.
              </p>
              <p>
                Chu stays useful throughout the game as a strong wave clear
                mythic and the best mythic for War Machine.
