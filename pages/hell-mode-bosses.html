<h2>Hell Mode Boss List</h2>
<p>
            In Hell Mode, every 10 waves you will get a random boss. At wave 50
            and above, 2 bosses will come out at a time. Each boss has something
            unique about themselves, either having an active skill they cast to
            attack your board, or having a special resistance or health bonus. All
            the different effects are listed below:
          </p>
<p>
<strong>Note: Bandit Boss was removed from all modes for now.</strong>

<ul>
<li>
<img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/corrupted-bandit.webp"/>
              - Corrupt Bandit: Steal 30% money each cast.
            </li>
<li>
<img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/bad-shaman.webp"/>
              - Night Shaman: Draws a magic circle on random spaces, and instantly
              mutates the unit in those spaces into another random unit. The
              mutation is chosen from the same rarity of the original unit, and
              this includes units in their untransformed state as well as "Imps"
              that can only be summoned by Mama's skills. You can avoid the
              mutation by moving the unit at that time. The timing is strict,
              but...
            </li>
<li>
<img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/coldest.webp"/>
              - Coldest: Randomly targets a unit and inflicts the debuff "Reduced
              Attack Speed" on it. This debuff lasts for 20 waves.
            </li>
<li>
<img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/magic.webp"/>
              - Magician: Red warning = cast red circle on 9 random squares, and
              after a few seconds, a meteor will rain down on the unit in that
              square and destroy it. Green warning = periodically selfheal and
              recover its own HP.
            </li>
<li>
<img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/reaper.webp"/>
              - Reaper: A red circle will be displayed on several random units,

<li>
<img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/smile-doctor.webp"/>

              debuff lasts for 10 waves.
            </li>
