          <h2>Hell Mode Boss List</h2>
          <p>
            In Hell Mode, every 10 waves you will get a random boss. At wave 50
            and above, 2 bosses will come out at a time. Each boss has something
            unique about themselves, either having an active skill they cast to
            attack your board, or having a special resistance or health bonus.
            All the different effects are listed below:

                src="../pics/boss-pics/corrupted-bandit.webp"

              <img class="inline-img" src="../pics/boss-pics/bad-shaman.webp" />
              - Night Shaman: Draws a magic circle on random spaces, and
              instantly mutates the unit in those spaces into another random
              unit. The mutation is chosen from the same rarity of the original
              unit, and this includes units in their untransformed state as well
              as "Imps" that can only be summoned by Mama's skills. You can
              avoid the mutation by moving the unit at that time. The timing is
              strict, but...
