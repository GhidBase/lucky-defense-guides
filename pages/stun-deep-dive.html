                <div class="text-width">
                    <p>
                        <strong>Stun/sec</strong> is the expected stun dished
                        out per second by one full stack (either 3x non-mythic
                        or 1x mythic). This number gives you an idea how
                        effective the stack is at keeping enemies stunned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another factor to take note of is the consistency of
                        stuns. If your stuns are inconsistent then enemies might
                        be able to walk through your stun zone before the stun
                        triggers. Stun consistency is dependent on both stun/sec
                        and attack frequency. It is recommended to have at least
                        6 stun units on both sides (meaning at least 12
                        combined) to provide enough attack frequency for stun
                        consistency.

                    <p>
                        <strong>Factors which are not included above:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Attack speed increase:</strong> Increases
                            stun/sec but doesn't change the ranking
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Old Book artifact:</strong> This artifact
                            increases skill activation chance which slightly
                            favours units with lower skill activation chance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What about Coldy 6?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Coldy 6 isn’t on the list as her contribution to
                        stunlock comes from more than just her stun per second.
                        She has passive 50 slow and her Ice Flower skill further
                        slows affected enemies by 50 speed. This gives your
                        other stunners more time to re-stun any enemies which
                        break out of their stunlock before they leave the stun
                        zone. Her stun itself is nothing to shout about (0.48
                        stun/sec) but the other contributing factors make her
                        one of the strongest stun units in the game. However,
                        she's a bit nerfed because her stun range is so massive
                        that she sometimes causes stun where it's not wanted.
                        She does require a Storm Giant to summon as well, and
                        that could potentially be used for other helpful
                        mythics.
