                    <p>
                        Have you ever had a game where you had 10+ mythics on
                        the board all at the same time, but still somehow lost?
                        You get so many strong mythics out there, you feel like
                        you should win easily but you don't? This happens all
                        the time, and it's because people don't know that a
                        couple of the

                        Using stun to increase damage
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        Why are these listed as some of the best units? Let's
                        say you have a mythic that can hit an entire group of
                        enemies really hard, but all the enemies are spread out
                        far apart like in this picture.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="max-width-img"
                        src="../pics/stun-guide/spread-out-enemies.jpg"
                    />
                    <p>
                        When batman uses his ult or any of his strongest
                        attacks, he's only going to hit the enemies that are
                        right next to him. So what if we stun all the enemies so
                        that they're all clumped together right next to batman?
                        Take the following clip for example.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="max-width-img"
                        src="../pics/stun-guide/successfull-stun.gif"
                    />
                    <p>
                        <strong
                            >Every time batman does his heavy attack, he hits
                            every enemy currently in the game.</strong
                        >
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        For this demonstration, me and the other player both
                        sell our stun units right after this same clip. Watch
                        what happens when we do that.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="max-width-img"
                        src="../pics/stun-guide/selling-stuns.gif"

                    <p>
                        Instantly they overwhelm us. None of them are taking
                        much damage anymore. They're nearly at full health when
                        they run past and start to surround the entire
                        battlefield. We lost that game as soon as we sold all
                        our stuns.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-header">How much stun do you need?</h2>
                    <p>
                        If you have enough stun, the enemies should be almost
                        completely locked in place right next to your attacking
                        mythics. A very common stun layout is to have 1 full
                        stack of the epic electro bot, and 2 full stacks of the
                        blue shock robot, and have the same layout on both
                        sides. Below is an example of a stun layout that is very
                        close to that.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="max-width-img"
                        src="../pics/stun-guide/stun-layout-example.jpg"
                    />
                    <p>
                        In this picture, we have 1 full stack of purple stun on
                        both sides, and 2 full stacks of blue stun on both
                        sides. Here we also have it moved more towards the back
                        end so that our monopoly men can get more lucky coins
                        from casting their ults while they head towards the stun
                        we've placed next to our dps mythics. You can put stuns
                        close to the front as well, as long as you're stunning
                        the enemies within range of your dps mythics.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Using these stun placements, the information in
                        <a href="./defense-reduction.html">
                            the defense reduction guide</a
                        >, at least level 1 <a href="./sb-mg.html">sb/mg,</a>
                        and some practice, you can start to carry normal mode
                        easily. With level 3 sb/mg, you can start clearing hard
                        mode regularly.
                    </p>

                        Wait, but how do all stun units in the game really stack
                        up? If you want to see a detailed breakdown that
                        compares all the most common stun options against each

                    <p>
                        <strong>Stun/sec</strong> is the expected stun dished
                        out per second by one full stack (either 3x non-mythic
                        or 1x mythic). This number gives you an idea how
                        effective the stack is at keeping enemies stunned.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Another factor to take note of is the consistency of
                        stuns. If your stuns are inconsistent then enemies might
                        be able to walk through your stun zone before the stun
                        triggers. Stun consistency is dependent on both stun/sec
                        and attack frequency. It is recommended to have at least
                        6 stun units on both sides (meaning at least 12
                        combined) to provide enough attack frequency for stun
                        consistency.

                        <strong>Factors which are not included above:</strong>
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Attack speed increase:</strong> Increases
                            stun/sec but doesn't change the ranking
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            <strong>Old Book artifact:</strong> This artifact
                            increases skill activation chance which slightly
                            favours units with lower skill activation chance.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p><strong>What about Coldy 6?</strong></p>
                    <p>
                        Coldy 6 isn’t on the list as her contribution to
                        stunlock comes from more than just her stun per second.
                        She has passive 50 slow and her Ice Flower skill further
                        slows affected enemies by 50 speed. This gives your
                        other stunners more time to re-stun any enemies which
                        break out of their stunlock before they leave the stun
                        zone. Her stun itself is nothing to shout about (0.48
                        stun/sec) but the other contributing factors make her
                        one of the strongest stun units in the game. However,
                        she's a bit nerfed because her stun range is so massive
                        that she sometimes causes stun where it's not wanted.
                        This means she's best used on attempts at full solo runs
                        where you're trying to do all your own damage AND
                        support, because she'll help you maximize on space, and
                        you can play around it better. She does require a Storm
                        Giant to summon as well, and that could potentially be
                        used for other helpful mythics, so really outside of
                        that one use case she doesn't see much play.
