            23k gold. Level 6 to level 12 costs 940 stones and 188k gold. This

          </strong>
        </p>

        <p>
          This is the order you should unlock/upgrade mythics in if you want the
          fastest possible route to clearing hard mode regularly. Explanations
          included.
        </p>

        <h3>The Main List</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Batman - level 1 (if you haven't cleared normal yet)</li>
          <li>Rocket Chu - level 6</li>
          <li>Master Kun - level 6</li>
          <li>Lancelot - level 6</li>
          <li>Kitty Mage - level 12</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Useful level 6 mythics</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Vayne</li>
          <li>Coldy</li>
          <li>Verdee</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>The best second and third level 12 mythic</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Lancelot</li>
          <li>Lazy Taoist</li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Why this order?</h2>
        <h3>Batman and Rocket Chu - Level 6</h3>
        <p>
          When you're starting out, you're going to want to get the two units
          that can carry you through normal mode by themselves - Batman and
          Rocket Chu. Batman is great at level 1. The reason I reccomend having
          him at level 1 for so long is because upgrading mythics is all about
          the skills they unlock at their various levels, it's not really about
          the damage increase.
        </p>

        <p>
          At level 6, batman will feel mostly the same for you. However, at
          level 1, Rocket Chu will succeed his overclock 35% of the time. At
          level 6, Rocket Chu will succeed 50% of the time.
          <strong>This is a huge upgrade.</strong>
          Not only is this a huge improvement, but Rocket Chu is basically a
          second Batman, but a little bit stronger, and can attack from range.
        </p>

        <h3>Master Kun - Level 6</h3>

        <p>
          Master Kun unlocks after you beat normal mode for the first time.
          Functionally, Kun and Batman are very similar. They're both melee
          units that power up mid-game using their abilities. Batman upgrades
          skill costs gold, while Kuns upgrade is his ult. This means that while
          Batman can upgrade much faster, Kun can upgrade without costing you
          gold. Since gold is the biggest source of damage in the game, this
          makes Kun much better.
        </p>

        <h3>Lancelot - Level 6</h3>
        <p>
          Lancelot is one of the best units in the entire game. Important note:
          Lancelot is not worth using in normal mode. He won't make much of a
          difference on wave clear in most cases, and in normal mode Batman and
          Rocket Chu can clear the waves AND the bosses just fine by themselves.
          With this in mind, don't use Lancelot in normal mode. But in hard
          mode, he is the strongest boss killer. When he's not level 6 though,
          he doesn't have his ult. This makes him practically useless. This is
          because
          <strong
            >when he performs a skill, every hit that skill lands does up to 2%
            of the enemies health in damage. His ult is great for this because
            it counts as 10 skill hits back to back.</strong
          >
          If you pair this with a bunch of mp regen from Kitty Mage, you can get
          your Lancelot to spam his ult over and over, making the boss of Wave
          80 on hard mode very easy.
        </p>

        <h3>Kitty Mage - Level 12</h3>
        <p>
          Kitty Mage is great. They passively increase MP Regen for all units on
          both sides. His ult instantly recovers 10% mp for all non-Kitty Mages.
          That's super good with all characters that have ults. But Kitty 12's
          upgrade is insane. It says "increases MP Regen from skills by +100%".
          This is already great. But what can be missed here is this also
          affects their ult. So not only will Kitty Mage go from 20% Mp Regen to
          40% Mp Regen, but every time they pop their ult, it will recharge 20%
          of the ult of every non-Kitty Mage in their attack range. This is
          almost overpowered. Every other level 12 unlock is outshined by this
          one. If you have been playing for awhile without it, and you try a
          game with Kitty 12 the difference is immediately obvious.
        </p>

        <h2>What next?</h2>
        <p>
          We in the discord discussed at long length what comes after Kitty Mage
          12. The conclusion was that the only thing <b>needed</b> to beat hard
          mode regularly were those 4 mythics above. However, these next 3 units
          are great at only level 6, and having them will make clearing hard mode
          much easier. This way, you can get a bunch of good upgrades fast, before
          deciding to save up for your next level 12 upgrade.
        </p>

        <h3>Vayne - Level 6</h3>
        <p>
          Vayne is an interesting character because when you summon her, she
          seems useless. That's the first impression she'll give 90% of players.
          However, she is one of the best possible tools to add to your kit when
          you're trying to clear hard mode more often. The reason is, once you
          get Vayne to level 6 she gets her ult. Her ult is strong enough to
          clear the dungeon easily.
          <strong>Vayne will NOT help clear waves though.</strong> Keep that in
          mind. But getting Vayne early, and knowing that she can't clear waves,
          it's basically a "clear the dungeon free" card. Since she can't help
          outside of dungeon, you don't have to bounce her back and forth
          between dungeon and the main battlefield. Not only that, but she
          requires a Legendary that can only be used outside of summoning her,
          to summon Lazy Tao, or Coldy. Coldy is honestly great stun. However,
          Vayne starts to really shine on the late game bosses. Here's the
          thing, you can only have 2 Lancelots hitting a boss at one time.
          You're going to need a <b>lot</b> of Kitty Mage's to have Lancelot
          doing enough damage to kill the final boss. But even then, your two
          Lancelots might short just barely on damage. You can get a third
          Lancelot maybe and rotate him in whenever his ult is charged, or, you
          can get one or two Vayne's. If you have one or two Vayne's hitting the
          wave 80 boss, and two Lancelots, you're basically good to go even if
          your partner can't help you with boss clear. When you're just starting
          out, you're likely to most often struggle with the last boss. The only
          other thing to keep in mind is that Vayne does physical damage. So you
          need to support her with defense reduction. Shoot for 160 defense
          reduction. You'll also want to get as close to level 20
          legendary/mythic damage upgrade in game as you can,
          <strong>and you'll need at least 100k+ gold.</strong> Lancelot doesn't
          benefit from any of those things, but you do that, and Vayne will give
          you a little insurance on that last boss. Also, read how Vayne's
          tumble skill works. You'll want to use that as well.
        </p>

        <p>
          Eventually with Vayne level 12, and with only Safe Box and Money Gun
          level 4, you can finish the boss at the end with just Vaynes. Don't
          rush for Vayne level 12, this is just what to expect with Vayne 12.
          Choose the level 12s that seem fun/good to you. Lancelot level 12 is
          the second best 12 after Kitty Mage, (as you'll read below) and makes
          hard mode easy
        </p>

        <h3>Monopoly man - Level 6</h3>

        <p>
          Monopoly Man is a staple of hard mode. This is because he does two
          extremely good things. First and more obviously, he gives lucky coins.
          This is great because lucky coins are extremely valuable. But his
          second benefit is what causes him to be in every game - Each Monopoly
          Man gives you 20 Defense Reduction. This is extremely powerful. Level
          12 Hunter gives 15 Defense Reduction. He's the easiest source to get
          Defense Reduction from. Monopoly man not only gives more than that,
          but he doesn't use any epics to summon that give Defense Reduction.
          Orc Shaman uses a Hunter and a purple stun, so you gain 20 Defense
          Reduction, at the cost of 25 Defense Reduction. Monopoly Man costs you
          a Tree, a Wolf, and a Devil. You lost at most 7.5 Defense Reduction,
          but you gain 20. And since you keep all your hunters, if you start
          summoning a couple Monopoly Men to support your Batmen/Rocket
          Chu/Vayne, you'll be able to hit 160 Defense Reduction
          <strong>much</strong> quicker.
        </p>

        <p>Verdee - level 6</p>

        <p>
          Verdee is a good option to have because as long as you build up
          defense reduction, with the addition of Verdee you will always have
          and option for a strong wave clear as long as you merge epics into any
          legendary. Sheriff use to not have an early wave clear. Since Lancelot
          isn't able to keep you alive in the early game, getting Sheriff early
          use to be a dud. Now you have Verdee. She does rely a bit more on you
          having a good amount of stun because her attack have a lag before they
          hit. She does need the defense reduction because she's physical. But
          she's a solid addition to the wave clearing roster even at just level
          6, and since she's so cheap, she's a must get if you're trying to get
          more consistent clears in hard mode.
        </p>

        <h2>Second Level 12?</h2>

        <p>
          For the second level 12 mythic you get, you have more freedom. Once
          you have kitty mage 12, you can start clearing hard mode pretty
          regularly with many strategies. If you experiment with defense reduce,
          you'll really get the most out of Rocket Chu, and you'll even be able
          to start killing bosses with Vayne instead of Lance as long as you
          have Vayne 6. That being said, there are two level 12 upgrades that
          stand out as being particularly strong. Lancelot and Tao level 12.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Lancelot 12</h2>

        <p>
          If you've used Lancelot 6 you'll know that sometimes, it can get close
          on that wave 80 boss. With Lancelot level 12, his % damage is
          increased to from 2% per hit, to 3% per hit at max skill level. This
          is very powerful, and once you get this it makes clearing hard mode a
          lot easier. There's not much to say here. Get a Lancelot level 12, and
          support it with Kitty Mage 12, and it's going to be pretty difficult
          to not win. Lancelot will even clear waves for you at that point.
          You'll still need to survive long enough to get Lancelot set up, but
          it's very straightforward to do so.
        </p>

        <h2>Why Lazy Taoist 12</h2>

        <p>
          In Lucky Defense, some characters shine at particular levels. Batman,
          Chu, and Lancelot are good examples of this. While Batman doesn't gain
          as much as other mythics from being leveled up, Rocket Chu gets a big
          increase in his odds of surviving being overclocked at level 6. This
          is a huge buff that's well worth the affordable level 6 upgrade. With
          Lancelot, he unlocks his ult, and this is huge because his entire
          playstyle is centered around how often his ult comes out. Tao is
          similar to these other characters, with the exception being that his
          "glow-up" happens at level 12. Before level 12, he's not that good.
          His strong attack doesn't happen very often, and his other attack is
          basically useless. Once he's at level 12, his main attack will happen
          twice as often. Not only that, but his treasure is a direct increase
          to both the strength and fire rate of this main attack, making it one
          of the better treasures in the game. Since Tao also uses Storm
          Elemental, this means that when you're playing hard mode, if you opt
          to save your epics for merging, every time you get a legendary you
          have a 100% chance to get a powerful wave clear. Tiger gets Master
          Kun, War Machine gets Rocket Chu, Sheriff gets Verdee and now, Storm
          Elemental gets Lazy Taoist. Without being level 12, Tao isn't quite on
          the same level as the other two options. Level 12 puts them on a
          similar playing field, and it could even be argued that Tao outdamages
          the other two in certain cases. Once you get that Wave Clear Mythic,
          you're free to look for support and Boss Killer Mythics. Knowing this,
          Lazy Taoist is the clear best choice for the next character to take to
          level 12 after Lancelot 12, being useful past Hard Mode, and into Hell
          Mode.
