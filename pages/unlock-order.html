                <h2>What order should you unlock mythics in?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Note for context: to get a unit to level 6 it costs 115 stones
                    and 23k gold. Level 6 to level 12 costs 940 stones and 188k gold. This
                    guide was written with these things in mind.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is the order you should unlock/upgrade mythics in if you want the fastest
                    possible route to clearing hard mode regularly. Explanations included. 
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Batman - level 1</li>
                    <li>Rocket Chu - level 6</li>
                    <li>Lancelot - level 6</li>
                    <li>Kitty Mage - level 12</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Why this order?</h2>
                <h3>Batman - Level 1 and Rocket Chu - Level 6</h3>
                <p>
                    When you're starting out, you're going to want to get the two units that can
                    carry you through normal mode by themselves - Batman and Rocket Chu. Batman
                    is great at level 1. The reason I reccomend having him at level 1 for so long
                    is because upgrading mythics is all about the skills they unlock at their
                    various levels, it's not really about the damage increase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At level 6, batman will feel mostly the same for you. However, at level 1,
                    Rocket Chu will succeed his overclock 35% of the time. At level 6, Rocket
                    Chu will succeed 50% of the time. <strong>This is a huge upgrade.</strong>
                    Not only is this a huge improvement, but Rocket Chu is basically a second
                    Batman, but a little bit stronger, and can attack from range.
                </p>

                <h3>Lancelot - Level 6</h3>
                <p>
                    Lancelot is one of the best units in the entire game. Important note:
                    Lancelot is not worth using in normal mode. He won't make much of a
                    difference on wave clear in most cases, and in normal mode Batman and
                    Rocket Chu can clear the waves AND the bosses just fine by themselves.
                    With this in mind, don't use Lancelot in normal mode. But in hard mode,
                    he is the strongest boss killer. When he's not level 6 though, he
                    doesn't have his ult. This makes him practically useless.
                    This is because <strong>when he performs a skill, every hit that skill
                    lands does up to 2% of the enemies health in damage. His ult is great
                    for this because it counts as 10 skill hits back to back.</strong>
                    If you pair this with a bunch of mp regen from Kitty Mage, you can
                    get your Lancelot to spam his ult over and over, making the boss of Wave
                    80 on hard mode very easy.
                </p>

                <h3>Kitty Mage - Level 12</h3>
                <p>
                    Kitty Mage is great. They passively increase MP Regen for all units
                    on both sides. His ult instantly recovers 10% mp for all non-Kitty
                    Mages. That's super good with all characters that have ults. But
                    Kitty 12's upgrade is insane. It says "increases MP Regen from skills
                    by +100%". This is already great. But what can be missed here is this
                    also affects their ult. So not only will Kitty Mage go from 20% Mp
                    Regen to 40% Mp Regen, but every time they pop their ult, it will
                    recharge 20% of the ult of every non-Kitty Mage in their attack
                    range. This is almost overpowered. Every other level 12 unlock is
                    outshined by this one. If you have been playing for awhile without
                    it, and you try a game with Kitty 12 the difference is immediately
                    obvious.
                </p>

                <h2>What next?</h2>
                <p>
                    We in the discord discussed at long length what comes after Kitty Mage 12.
                    The conclusion was that the only thing <b>needed</b> to beat hard
                    mode regularly were those 4 mythics above. However in my experience,
                    these next two units should be your next priority if you really just
                    want to beat hard mode more often:
                </p>

                <h3>Vayne - Level 6</h3>
                <p>
                    Vayne is an interesting character because when you summon her, she seems
                    useless. That's the first impression she'll give 90% of players. However,
                    she is one of the best possible tools to add to your kit when you're
                    trying to clear hard mode more often. The reason is, once you get Vayne
                    to level 6 she gets her ult. Her ult is strong enough to clear the dungeon
                    easily. <strong>Vayne will NOT help clear waves though.</strong> Keep that
                    in mind. But getting Vayne early, and knowing that she can't clear waves,
                    it's basically a "clear the dungeon free" card. Since she can't help outside
                    of dungeon, you don't have to bounce her back and forth between dungeon and
                    the main battlefield. Not only that, but she requires a Legendary that can
                    only be used outside of summoning her, to summon Lazy Tao, or Coldy. Coldy
                    is honestly great stun. However, Vayne starts to really shine on the late game
                    bosses. Here's the thing, you can only have 2 Lancelots hitting a boss at
                    one time. You're going to need a <b>lot</b> of Kitty Mage's to have Lancelot
                    doing enough damage to kill the final boss. But even then, your two Lancelots
                    might short just barely on damage. You can get a third Lancelot maybe and rotate
                    him in whenever his ult is charged, or, you can get one or two Vayne's. If you have
                    one or two Vayne's hitting the wave 80 boss, and two Lancelots, you're basically
                    good to go even if your partner can't help you with boss clear. When you're just
                    starting out, you're likely to most often struggle with the last boss. The only
                    other thing to keep in mind is that Vayne does physical damage. So you need to
                    support her with defense reduction. Shoot for 200 defense reduction. You'll also
                    want to get as close to level 20 legendary/mythic damage upgrade in game as you
                    can, <strong>and you'll need at least 100k+ gold.</strong> Lancelot doesn't benefit
                    from any of those things, but you do that, and Vayne will give you a little insurance
                    on that last boss. Also, read how Vayne's tumble skill works. You'll want to use that
                    as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Eventually with Vayne level 12, and with only Safe Box and Money Gun level 4,
                    you can finish the boss at the end with just Vaynes. Don't rush for Vayne level 12,
                    this is just what to expect with Vayne 12. Choose the level 12s that seem fun/good to
                    you. Lancelot level 12 is the second best 12 after Kitty Mage, (as you'll read below)
                    and makes hard mode easy
                </p>

                <h3>Monopoly man - Level 6</h3>

                <p>
                    Monopoly Man is a staple of hard mode. This is because he does two extremely good things.
                    First and more obviously, he gives lucky coins. This is great because lucky coins are
                    extremely valuable. But his second benefit is what causes him to be in every game -
                    Each Monopoly Man gives you 20 Defense Reduction. This is extremely powerful. Level 12
                    Hunter gives 15 Defense Reduction. He's the easiest source to get Defense Reduction from.
                    Monopoly man not only gives more than that, but he doesn't use any epics to summon that
                    give Defense Reduction. Orc Shaman uses a Hunter and a purple stun, so you gain 20 Defense
                    Reduction, at the cost of 25 Defense Reduction. Monopoly Man costs you a Tree, a Wolf, and
                    a Devil. You lost at most 7.5 Defense Reduction, but you gain 20. And since you keep all your
                    hunters, if you start summoning a couple Monopoly Men to support your Batmen/Rocket Chu/Vayne,
                    you'll be able to hit 200 Defense Reduction <strong>much</strong> quicker.
                </p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Coldy - level 6 - Slow + Stun improved by MP Regen from Kitty Mage</li>
                    <li>Dragon - level 6 - Very cheap to summon, solid wave clear and dungeon clear</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Finally, Lancelot level 12</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the mythics listed above, Lancelot is the next best
                    mythic to have at level 12. Sometimes, it feels like it can
                    get close on that wave 80 boss. With Lancelot level 12, his
                    % damage is increased to 3% per hit at max skill level. This
                    is very powerful, and once you get this it makes clearing hard
                    mode a lot easier. Afer this, it's all personal preference.
                    You have all the best mythics now! You can get these mythics
                    to be stronger, or you can explore other mythics for fun like
                    Blob. Experiment and have fun with it, and join the discord if
                    you want some other perspectives on where to go after this.
