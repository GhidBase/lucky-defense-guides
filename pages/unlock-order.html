                        In hard mode, one early challenge you'll face is how to
                        clear dungeon. Honestly, as long as you spend some luck
                        stones throughout the game on upgrading you mythic
                        damage, all of these units will clear dungeon:

                                Lazy Taoist aka Tao rounds out your DPS options
                                for each Legendary. Tao requires a Storm Giant
                                (legendary), a Ranger (rare) and a Water
                                Elemental (common) to summon. The reason Tao
                                comes after the other two support mythics is
                                because Tao has weak base damage but good skills
                                and hence really needs your sb/mg to be higher
                                (3+, ideally 4+) to start being effective. In
                                the meantime, Kitty and Mono provide immediate
                                benefits.

                                At level 12, Tao’s Razorwind doubles in chance
                                to trigger. Razorwind is THE skill behind Tao’s
                                damage output. Doubling the trigger chance of
                                this skill practically doubles Tao’s damage.
                                Tao’s exclusive treasure (Obsidian Hand Fan)
                                also boosts Razorwind and is an important
                                treasure to get.

                                Lance is a boss killer mythic. His ability to
                                kill bosses comes from his passive skill Flame
                                which deals a percentage of the target’s max
                                health whenever he deals skill damage. This can
                                be upgraded with luck stones in-game from the
                                base of 0.2% to 2.2% (10 upgrades, 2 luck stones
                                per upgrade) per skill damage. Having dedicated

                                counts of skill damage hence his Flame will deal
                                22% of the boss max hp whenever Flame Pillar is

                                This percentage-based damage is invaluable
                                whenever your sb/mg is too low such that your
                                other mythics cannot deal sufficient damage in

                                However, remember that increasing MP Regen is
                                crucial to maximising Lance’s effect.

                                Mono and level 12 Hunters (15 DR) are the most
                                convenient sources of DR. Mono requires a Tree
                                (epic), a Wolf Warrior (epic) and a Demon
                                Soldier (rare) to summon, giving 20 DR at the
                                cost of 7.5 DR. Orc Shaman has 20 DR but uses a
                                Hunter (epic), an Electro Robot (epic) and a
                                Demon Solder (common) which actually has total
                                27.5 DR (when all level 12) and hence is a net
                                reduction of DR. Blob has 20 DR but firstly is
                                just not a good mythic to summon, and anyway
                                requires a Hunter (epic), an Eagle (epic) and a
                                Bandit (common) to summon losing you 15 DR, 5%
                                increased attack speed and an important
                                contributor to your gold economy.

                                Mono will see much use in Normal and Hard. Even
                                if you are running Magical DPS, Mono’s luck
                                stone generation will still be beneficial. From
                                Hell onwards, it becomes more situational as
                                every space counts in Hell and sometimes Mono
                                may not qualify for a spot.
                            </p>

                                At level 6, the MP cost of Mono’s ult is reduced
                                by 20%. Coupled with the MP regained after each
                                use by the artifact Sage’s Yogurt, this allows
                                Mono’s ult to trigger more often.

                        that lets you build your mythic team in the most optimal
                        way. There's some overlap, but the two builds are

                    <p>
                        Choose one of these two builds and you can quickly get a
                        high level hell-ready build. The easier to play build is
                        magic, but when played well, physical damage seems to
                        have an edge. You'll see many high-level players use a
                        blend of both strategies. The idea there is to play what
                        you get. Get a ton of eagles? Lean into the magic
                        damage. Get a bunch of hunters? Add some Chus to the
                        board and easily clear waves. If you're doing a hybrid
                        like this, it's good to get Watt and save him for the
                        final wave. If you're focusing physical, Vayne will
                        clear all wave 80 bosses including Barrier. Regardless,
                        check out the two builds and it'll be easier to choose
                        your next mythics to level.
