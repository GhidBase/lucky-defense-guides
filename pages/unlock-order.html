                <h2>What order should you unlock mythics in?</h2>
                
                <p>
                    <strong>Note for context: to get a unit to level 6 it costs 115 stones
                    and 23k gold. Level 6 to level 12 costs 940 stones and 188k gold. This
                    guide was written with these things in mind.
                    </strong>
                </p>
                
                <p>
                    This is the order you should unlock/upgrade mythics in if you want the fastest
                    possible route to clearing hard mode regularly. Explanations included. 
                </p>

                <ol>
                    <li>Batman - level 1</li>
                    <li>Rocket - Chu level 6</li>
                    <li>Lancelot - level 6</li>
                    <li>Kitty Mage - level 12</li>
                </ol>

                <h2>Why this order?</h2>
                <h3>Batman and Rocket Chu</h3>
                <p>
                    When you're starting out, you're going to want to get the two units that can
                    carry you through normal mode by themselves - Batman and Rocket Chu. Batman
                    is great at level 1. The reason I reccomend having him at level 1 for so long
                    is because upgrading mythics is all about the skills they unlock at their
                    various levels, it's not really about the damage increase.
                </p>

                <p>
                    At level 6, batman will feel mostly the same for you. However, at level 1,
                    Rocket Chu will succeed his overclock 35% of the time. At level 6, Rocket
                    Chu will succeed 50% of the time. <strong>This is a huge upgrade.</strong>
                    Not only is this a huge improvement, but Rocket Chu is basically a second
                    Batman, but a little bit stronger, and can attack from range.
                </p>

                <h3>Lancelot</h3>
                <p>
                    Lancelot is one of the best units in the entire game. When he's not level
                    6 though, he doesn't have his ult. This makes him practically useless.
                    This is because <strong>when he performs a skill, every hit that skill
                    lands does up to 2% of the enemies health in damage. His ult is great
                    for this because it counts as 10 skill hits back to back.</strong>
                    If you pair this with a bunch of mp regen from Kitty Mage, you can
                    get your Lancelot to spam his ult over and over, making the boss of Wave
                    80 on hard mode very easy.
                </p>

                <h3>Kitty Mage</h3>
                <p>
                    Kitty Mage is great. They passively increase MP Regen for all units
                    on both sides. His ult instantly recovers 10% mp for all non-Kitty
                    Mages. That's super good with all characters that have ults. But
                    Kitty 12's upgrade is insane. It says "increases MP Regen from skills
                    by +100%". This is already great. But what can be missed here is this
                    also affects their ult. So not only will Kitty Mage go from 20% Mp
                    Regen to 40% Mp Regen, but every time they pop their ult, it will
                    recharge 20% of the ult of every non-Kitty Mage in their attack
                    range. This is almost overpowered. Every other level 12 unlock is
                    outshined by this one. If you have been playing for awhile without
                    it, and you try a game with Kitty 12 the difference is immediately
                    obvious.
                </p>

                <h2>What next?</h2>
                <p>
                    We in the discord discussed at long length what comes after KM 12.
                    The conclusion was that the only thing <b>needed</b> to beat hard
                    mode regularly were those 4 mythics above. Below is a list of
                    mythics that you can't go wrong with after KM 12. 
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Coldy - level 6 - Slow + Stun improved by MP Regen from KM 12</li>
                    <li>Monopoly Man - level 6 - Econ boost and Defense Reduce</li>
                    <li>Vayne - level 6 - Some extra damage for when you're not sure if Lancelot can do it himself</li>
                    <li>Dragon - level 6 - Very cheap to summon, great wave clear and dungeon clear</li>
                </ul>

                <h2>Finally, Lancelot level 12</h2>
                <p>
                    Beyond the mythics listed above, Lancelot is the next best
                    mythic to have at level 12. Sometimes, it feels like it can
                    get close on that wave 80 boss. With Lancelot level 12, his
                    % damage is increased to 3% per hit at max skill level. This
                    is very powerful, and once you get this it makes clearing hard
                    mode a lot easier. Afer this, it's all personal preference.
                    You have all the best mythics now! You can get these mythics
                    to be stronger, or you can explore other mythics for fun like
                    Blob. Experiment and have fun with it, and join the discord if
                    you want some other perspectives on where to go after this.
