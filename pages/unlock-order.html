          <h3>Quick Note About Hard Mode Dungeon:</h3>
          <p>
            In hard mode, one early challenge you'll face is how to clear
            dungeon. Honestly, as long as you spend some luck stones throughout
            the game on upgrading you mythic damage, all of these units will
            clear dungeon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Batman</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu</li>
            <li>Hailey</li>
            <li>Master Kun</li>
            <li>Vayne</li>
            <li>Tao (level 12)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is good to keep in mind. If you get storm elemental, another
            good reason to summon Vayne is that at level 6, she becomes strong
            enough to solo dungeon as long as you level up your mythic damage
            mid game. This means that since she can't clear waves, you can keep
            any of the other units I listed above out on the field handling the
            waves and Vayne can stay in dungeon clearing that for you.

              <p>
                Lancelot aka Lance is the first mythic in preparation for Hard
                mode. Lance is useless in Normal mode so don’t bother summoning
                him during Normal (summon Hailey with your Sheriff instead).
                However, he is invaluable for Hard onwards. Lance requires a
                Sheriff (legendary), a Hunter (epic) and a Paladin (rare) to
                summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Lance is a boss killer mythic. His ability to kill bosses comes
                from his passive skill Flame which deals a percentage of the
                target’s max health whenever he deals skill damage. This can be
                upgraded with luck stones in-game from the base of 0.2% to 2.2%
                (10 upgrades, 2 luck stones per upgrade) per skill damage.
              </p>
              <p>
                At level 6, Lance’s ult, Flame Pillar, is unlocked. Flame Pillar
                counts for 10 consecutive counts of skill damage hence his Flame
                will deal 22% of the boss max hp whenever Flame Pillar is cast.
                Flame Pillar is an MP-based ult this page

                and hence Lance is greatly supported by increasing your MP
                Regen.
              </p>
              <p>
                This percentage-based damage is invaluable whenever your sb/mg
                is too low such that your other mythics cannot deal sufficient
                damage in time to take down bosses. You can expect to use it to
                great effect when attempting Hard, Hell and God especially in
                your early attempts. However, remember that increasing MP Regen
                is crucial to maximising Lance’s effect.

              <p>
                Kitty Mage aka Kitty is the mythic to get after Lancelot and
                your first support mythic. Its skills increase MP Regen and
                restores MP to itself and allies. Kitty requires an Eagle
                (epic), two Water Elementals (common) and an Archer (common) to
                summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                When levelled to level 12, Kitty’s skills increasing MP Regen
                get +100% effectiveness. Her passive MP Regen of 20% increases
                to 40%. Her ult restores 20 MP instead of 10 MP to allies within
                range. Note that there is a typo in-game for the skill; it is
                20MP / 10 MP flat instead of 20% / 10%.
              </p>
              <p>
                With your current mythic collection, Kitty boosts Lancelot,
                Hailey and Master Kun by making their ults more frequent.
                Without Kitty, you will have a difficult time using Lancelot
                effectively in Hard mode (and higher difficulties).
              </p>
              <p>
                With Kitty 12 and Lance 6, you will be able to attempt and
                semi-consistently clear Hard from sb3 onwards.

              />
              <p>
                Monopoly Man aka Mono is another great support mythic. This is
                because he does two extremely good things. First his ult
                Mutation gains you a luck stone which makes him a great booster
                for your luck stone income. His ult is also MP-based and hence
                will benefit from Kitty’s MP Regen.
              </p>
              <p>
                His second benefit is passive 20 Defense Reduction (DR) which is
                greatly important for Physical DMG attackers. You want to target
                160 DR in Normal, 180 DR in Hard and 200 DR in Hell by W80 to
                keep your Physical DPS attacks boosted see
                <a

              </p>
              <p>
                Mono and level 12 Hunters (15 DR) are the most convenient
                sources of DR. Mono requires a Tree (epic), a Wolf Warrior
                (epic) and a Demon Soldier (rare) to summon, giving 20 DR at the
                cost of 7.5 DR. Orc Shaman has 20 DR but uses a Hunter (epic),
                an Electro Robot (epic) and a Demon Solder (common) which
                actually has total 27.5 DR (when all level 12) and hence is a
                net reduction of DR. Blob has 20 DR but firstly is just not a
                good mythic to summon, and anyway requires a Hunter (epic), an
                Eagle (epic) and a Bandit (common) to summon losing you 15 DR,
                5% increased attack speed and an important contributor to your
                gold economy.
              </p>
              <p>
                Mono will see much use in Normal and Hard. Even if you are
                running Magical DPS, Mono’s luck stone generation will still be
                beneficial. From Hell onwards, it becomes more situational as
                every space counts in Hell and sometimes Mono may not qualify
                for a spot.
              </p>
              <p>
                At level 6, the MP cost of Mono’s ult is reduced by 20%. Coupled
                with the MP regained after each use by the artifact Sage’s
                Yogurt, this allows Mono’s ult to trigger more often.

              <b>Vayne - Level 6</b
              ><img
                class="mini icon"
                src="../pics/unit/mythics/Vayne.png"
                alt=""
              />
              <p>
                Vayne is an interesting character because when you summon her,
                she seems useless. That's the first impression she'll give 90%
                of players. However, she is the only other real alternative to
                Lance and Watt for boss clears. Vayne requires a Storm Giant
                (legendary), a Hunter (epic), a Ranger (rare) and an Archer
                (common) to summon.
              </p>
              <p>
                Vayne's Tumble skill is greatly important for increasing her
                damage. Her next basic attack does 3000% Physical DMG after
                being manually moved. Her base attack speed is slow so there is
                little worry that using Tumble lowers her damage output. Just
                make sure that she attacks before moving her again.
              </p>
              <p>
                She is also a great option when you're trying to clear Hard more
                often. The reason is, once you get Vayne to level 6, every third
                attack does 5000% damage. This is strong enough to clear the
                dungeon easily, and it also stacks with her ult (+5000% * +400%,
                it's very strong). Vayne will NOT help clear waves though. Keep
                that in mind. But getting Vayne early, and knowing that she
                can't clear waves, it's basically a "clear the dungeon free"
                card. Since she can't help outside of dungeon, you don't have to
                bounce her back and forth between dungeon and the main
                battlefield.
              </p>
              <p>
                Not only that, but she requires a legendary that can only be
                used outside of summoning her, to summon Tao, Watt or Coldy. Tao
                is always a viable option. Watt is useless in Hard. Coldy is
                honestly great stun if you get her to level 6. However, Vayne
                starts to really shine on the late game bosses.
              </p>
              <p>
                Here's the thing, you can only have 2 Lances hitting a boss at
                one time. You're going to need a lot of Kitties to have Lances
                doing enough damage to kill the final boss. But even then, your
                two Lances might just barely be short on damage. You can get a
                third Lancelot maybe and rotate him in whenever his ult is
                charged, or, you can get one or two Vaynes. If you have one or
                two Vayne's hitting the wave 80 boss, and two Lancelots, you're
                basically good to go even if your partner can't help you with
                boss clear which is often the biggest obstacle to clearing Hard.

              <p>
                Lazy Taoist aka Tao rounds out your DPS options for each
                Legendary. Tao requires a Storm Giant (legendary), a Ranger
                (rare) and a Water Elemental (common) to summon. The reason Tao
                comes after the other two support mythics is because Tao has
                weak base damage but good skills and hence really needs your
                sb/mg to be higher (3+, ideally 4+) to start being effective. In
                the meantime, Kitty and Mono provide immediate benefits.
              </p>
              <p>
                At level 12, Tao’s Razorwind doubles in chance to trigger.
                Razorwind is THE skill behind Tao’s damage output. Doubling the
                trigger chance of this skill practically doubles Tao’s damage.
                Tao’s exclusive treasure (Obsidian Hand Fan) also boosts
                Razorwind and is an important treasure to get.

                Bringing Hailey to level 12 is important again for multiple reasons.

          <h1>Summary</h1>
          <p>
            At this point, you have a solid collection of mythics which should
            be helping you to clear Hard consistently. To help you make your
            next choice on what to level up, you can refer to
            <a href="https://luckydefenseguides.com/pages/mythic-roles.html">
              Mythic Categories
            </a>
            where I go over all the different mythic categories, and rank
            them/explain what builds they synergize the most with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or even better, you can use these two meta hell mode builds I've
            typed up to help you choose mythics in a way that lets you build
            your mythic team in the most optimal way. There's some overlap, but
            the two builds are
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <a href="physical-hell-build.html">Physical Meta</a>
            </li>
            <li><a href="magic-hell-build.html">Magic Meta</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Choose one of these two builds and you can quickly get a high level
            hell-ready build. The easier to play build is magic, but when played
            well, physical damage seems to have an edge. You'll see many
            high-level players use a blend of both strategies. The idea there is
            to play what you get. Get a ton of eagles? Lean into the magic
            damage. Get a bunch of hunters? Add some Chus to the board and
            easily clear waves. If you're doing a hybrid like this, it's good to
            get Watt and save him for the final wave. If you're focusing
            physical, Vayne will clear all wave 80 bosses including Barrier.
            Regardless, check out the two builds and it'll be easier to choose
            your next mythics to level.
          </p>
          <p>Good Luck!</p>
