          <p>
            This is the order you should unlock/upgrade mythics in if you want the
            fastest possible route to clearing hard mode regularly. Explanations
            included.
          </p>
          <h3>The Main List</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Batman - level 1 (if you haven't cleared normal yet)</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu - level 6</li>
            <li>Verdee - level 6</li>
            <li>Master Kun - level 6</li>
            <li>Lancelot - level 6</li>
            <li>Monopoly Man - level 6</li>
            <li>Kitty Mage - level 12</li>
            <li>Vayne - Level 6</li>
          </ol>
          <h3>Your next level 12 mythic</h3>
          <ol>
            <li>Lancelot</li>
            <li>Lazy Taoist</li>
          </ol>
          <h2>Why this order?</h2>
          <h3>Batman - level 1</h3>
          <p>
            When you're starting out, you'll not have many options available to
            you. Most mythics are blocked off until you clear normal mode for the
            first time. But for 3000 diamonds, you get access to Batman. Batman is
            great at level 1, and it's recomended you keep him at that level.
          </p>
          <p>After you get Batman, read</p>
          <ul class="no-pad">
            <li><a href="./sb-mg.html">the guide about safebox/money gun</a></li>
            <li><a href="./stun-guide.html">the guide about stuns</a></li>

              >
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>and you will have everything you need to beat normal mode.</p>
          <p>
            Alternatively, if you go to the
            <a target="blank" href="https://discord.com/invite/luckydefense"
              >official Lucky Defense discord</a
            >, you can find many people willing to help you get your first win
            easily. However you do it, once you beat normal you'll gain access to
            the full list of mythics. Start with the ones below for the quickest
            progression.
          </p>
          <h3>Quick Note About Hard Mode Dungeon:</h3>
          <p>
            In hard mode, one early challenge you'll face is how to clear dungeon.
            Honestly, as long as you spend some luck stones throughout the game on
            upgrading you mythic damage, all of these units will clear dungeon:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Batman</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu</li>
            <li>Verdee</li>
            <li>Master Kun</li>
            <li>Vayne</li>
            <li>Tao (level 12)</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            This is good to keep in mind. If you get storm elemental, another good
            reason to summon Vayne is that at level 6, she becomes strong enough
            to solo dungeon as long as you level up your mythic damage mid game.
            This means that since she can't clear waves, you can keep any of the
            other units I listed above out on the field handling the waves and
            Vayne can stay in dungeon clearing that for you.
          </p>
          <h3>Rocket Chu - Level 6</h3>
          <p>
            I mentioned that batman will feel mostly the same for you, so I would
            leave him at level 1. But Rocket Chu sees a big improvement at level
            6. Rocket Chu has an upgrade ability that makes him significantly more
            powerful, or it will fail, and he'll explode, dealing damage to the
            area around him, and killing him. At level 1, he'll only succeed in
            upgrading 35% of the time. At level 6, Rocket Chu will succeed 50% of
            the time.
            <strong>This is a huge upgrade.</strong>
            Not only is this a huge improvement, but Rocket Chu is basically a
            second Batman, but a little bit stronger, and can attack from range.
            He won't seem more powerful starting out, but his damage increases
            more than Batmans damage does when using safebox and money gun. Chu is
            arguably the strongest wave clear mythic in the entire game at the
            time of writing.
          </p>
          <h3>Verdee - level 6</h3>
          <p>
            Verdee is a good option to have because assuming you have Rocket Chu
            and either Batman or Master Kun, you'll have a mythic capable of
            clearing normal mode 3 out of 4 times you summon a legendary.
            (Batman/Kun for Tiger, Rocket Chu for War Machine, Verdee for Sheriff)
            Her strongest attack, other than her summon, has a 10 second delay so
            you will need to focus on getting really good stun. Also, she does
            need defense reduction because she's physical. She's a solid addition
            to the wave clearing roster even at just level 6, and since she's so
            cheap, she's a must get if you're trying to get more consistent clears
            in hard mode.
          </p>
          <h3>Master Kun - Level 6</h3>
          <p>
            Master Kun unlocks after you beat normal mode for the first time.
            Functionally, Kun and Batman are very similar. They're both melee
            units that power up mid-game using their abilities. Batman upgrades
            skill costs gold, while Kuns upgrade is his ult. This means that while
            Batman can upgrade much faster, Kun can upgrade without costing you
            gold. Since gold is the biggest source of damage in the game, this
            makes Kun much better.
          </p>
          <h3>Lancelot - Level 6</h3>
          <p>
            Lancelot is one of the best units in the entire game. Important note:
            Lancelot is not worth using in normal mode. He won't make much of a
            difference on wave clear in most cases, and in normal mode Batman and
            Rocket Chu can clear the waves AND the bosses just fine by themselves.
            With this in mind, don't use Lancelot in normal mode. But in hard
            mode, he is the strongest boss killer. When he's not level 6 though,
            he doesn't have his ult. This makes him practically useless. This is
            because
            <strong
              >when he performs a skill, every hit that skill lands does up to 2%
              of the enemies health in damage. His ult is great for this because
              it counts as 10 skill hits back to back.</strong
            >
            If you pair this with a bunch of mp regen from Kitty Mage, you can get
            your Lancelot to spam his ult over and over, making the boss of Wave
            80 on hard mode very easy.
          </p>
          <h3>Monopoly man - Level 6</h3>
          <p>
            Monopoly Man is a staple of hard mode. This is because he does two
            extremely good things. First and more obviously, he gives lucky coins.
            This is great because lucky coins are extremely valuable. But his
            second benefit is what causes him to be in every game - Each Monopoly
            Man gives you 20 Defense Reduction. This is extremely powerful. Level
            12 Hunter gives 15 Defense Reduction. He's the easiest source to get
            Defense Reduction from. Monopoly Man not only gives more than that,
            but he doesn't use any epics to summon that give Defense Reduction.
            Orc Shaman uses a Hunter and a purple stun, so you gain 20 Defense
            Reduction, at the cost of 25 Defense Reduction. Monopoly Man costs you
            a Tree, a Wolf, and a Devil. You lost at most 7.5 Defense Reduction,
            but you gain 20. And since you keep all your hunters, if you start
            summoning a couple Monopoly Men to support your Batmen/Rocket
            Chu/Vayne, you'll be able to hit 160 Defense Reduction
            <strong>much</strong> quicker.
          </p>
          <h3>Kitty Mage - Level 12</h3>
          <p>
            Kitty Mage is great. They passively increase MP Regen for all units on
            both sides. His ult instantly recovers 10% mp for all non-Kitty Mages.
            That's super good with all characters that have ults. But Kitty 12's
            upgrade is insane. It says "increases MP Regen from skills by +100%".
            This is already great. But what can be missed here is this also
            affects their ult. So not only will Kitty Mage go from 20% Mp Regen to
            40% Mp Regen, but every time they pop their ult, it will recharge 20%
            of the ult of every non-Kitty Mage in their attack range. This is
            almost overpowered. Every other level 12 unlock is outshined by this
            one. If you have been playing for a while without it, and you try a
            game with Kitty 12 the difference is immediately obvious.
          </p>
          <h3>Vayne - Level 6</h3>
          <p>
            Vayne is an interesting character because when you summon her, she
            seems useless. That's the first impression she'll give 90% of players.
            However, she is one of the best possible tools to add to your kit when
            you're trying to clear hard mode more often. The reason is, once you
            get Vayne to level 6 she gets her ult. Her ult is strong enough to
            clear the dungeon easily.
            <strong>Vayne will NOT help clear waves though.</strong> Keep that in
            mind. But getting Vayne early, and knowing that she can't clear waves,
            it's basically a "clear the dungeon free" card. Since she can't help
            outside of dungeon, you don't have to bounce her back and forth
            between dungeon and the main battlefield. Not only that, but she
            requires a Legendary that can only be used outside of summoning her,
            to summon Lazy Tao, or Coldy. Coldy is honestly great stun. However,
            Vayne starts to really shine on the late game bosses. Here's the
            thing, you can only have 2 Lancelots hitting a boss at one time.
            You're going to need a <b>lot</b> of Kitty Mage's to have Lancelot
            doing enough damage to kill the final boss. But even then, your two
            Lancelots might short just barely on damage. You can get a third
            Lancelot maybe and rotate him in whenever his ult is charged, or, you
            can get one or two Vayne's. If you have one or two Vayne's hitting the
            wave 80 boss, and two Lancelots, you're basically good to go even if
            your partner can't help you with boss clear. When you're just starting
            out, you're likely to most often struggle with the last boss. The only
            other thing to keep in mind is that Vayne does physical damage. So you
            need to support her with defense reduction. Shoot for 160 defense
            reduction. You'll also want to get as close to level 20
            legendary/mythic damage upgrade in game as you can,
            <strong>and you'll need at least 100k+ gold.</strong> Lancelot doesn't
            benefit from any of those things, but you do that, and Vayne will give
            you a little insurance on that last boss. Also, read how Vayne's
            tumble skill works. You'll want to use that as well.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eventually with Vayne level 12, and with only Safe Box and Money Gun
            level 4, you can finish the boss at the end with just Vaynes. Don't
            rush for Vayne level 12, this is just what to expect with Vayne 12.
            Choose the level 12s that seem fun/good to you. Lancelot level 12 is
            the second best 12 after Kitty Mage, (as you'll read below) and makes
            hard mode easy.
          </p>
          <h2>Second Level 12?</h2>
          <p>
            For the second level 12 mythic you get, you have more freedom. Once
            you have Kitty Mage 12, you can start clearing hard mode pretty
            regularly with many strategies. If you experiment with defense
            reduction, you'll really get the most out of Rocket Chu, and you'll
            even be able to start killing bosses with Vayne instead of Lance as
            long as you have Vayne 6. That being said, there are two level 12
            upgrades that stand out as being particularly strong. Lancelot and Tao
            level 12.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Lancelot 12</h2>
          <p>
            If you've used Lancelot 6 you'll know that sometimes, it can get close
            on that wave 80 boss. With Lancelot level 12, his % damage is
            increased to from 2% per hit, to 3% per hit at max skill level. This
            is very powerful, and once you get this it makes clearing hard mode a
            lot easier. There's not much to say here. Get a Lancelot level 12, and
            support it with Kitty Mage 12, and it's going to be pretty difficult
            to not win. Lancelot will even clear waves for you at that point.
            You'll still need to survive long enough to get Lancelot set up, but
            it's very straightforward to do so.
          </p>
          <h2>Why Lazy Taoist 12</h2>
          <p>
            In Lucky Defense, some characters shine at particular levels. Batman,
            Chu, and Lancelot are good examples of this. While Batman doesn't gain
            as much as other mythics from being leveled up, Rocket Chu gets a big
            increase in his odds of surviving being overclocked at level 6. This
            is a huge buff that's well worth the affordable level 6 upgrade. With
            Lancelot, he unlocks his ult, and this is huge because his entire
            playstyle is centered around how often his ult comes out. Tao is
            similar to these other characters, with the exception being that his
            "glow-up" happens at level 12. Before level 12, he's not that good.
            His strong attack doesn't happen very often, and his other attack is
            basically useless. Once he's at level 12, his main attack will happen
            twice as often. Not only that, but his treasure is a direct increase
            to both the strength and fire rate of this main attack, making it one
            of the better treasures in the game. Since Tao also uses Storm
            Elemental, this means that when you're playing hard mode, if you opt
            to save your epics for merging, every time you get a legendary you
            have a 100% chance to get a powerful wave clear. Tiger gets Master
            Kun, War Machine gets Rocket Chu, Sheriff gets Verdee and now, Storm
            Elemental gets Lazy Taoist. Without being level 12, Tao isn't quite on
            the same level as the other two options. Level 12 puts them on a
            similar playing field, and it could even be argued that Tao outdamages
            the other two in certain cases. Once you get that Wave Clear Mythic,
            you're free to look for support and Boss Killer Mythics. Knowing this,
            Lazy Taoist is the clear best choice for the next character to take to
            level 12 after Lancelot 12, being useful past Hard Mode, and into Hell
            Mode.
          </p>
          <h1>Why were other mythics not mentioned?</h1>
          <p>
            I chose to stop the list here because even there are some units that
            are obvious contenders for being the next level 12, these ones I've
            already talked about are the ones that will improve your hard clear
            rate the most. The next obvious one would be Rocket Chu 12, but he's
            not neccessary because he's incredibly strong at even level 6. After
            you get the mythics listed here, you are free to experiment. To help
            you make your next choice on what to level up, you can refer to
            <a href="mythic-roles.html">Mythic Categories</a> where I go over all
            the different mythic categories, and rank them/explain what builds
            they synergize the most with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Or even better, you can use these two meta hell mode builds I've typed
            up to help you choose mythics in a way that lets you build your mythic
            team in the most optimal way. There's some overlap, but the two builds
            are
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><a href="physical-hell-build.html">Physical Meta</a></li>
            <li><a href="magic-hell-build.html">Magic Meta</a></li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Choose one of these two builds and you can quickly get a high level
            hell-ready build. The easier to play build is magic, but when played
            well, physical damage seems to have an edge. You'll see many
            high-level players use a blend of both strategies. The idea there is
            to play what you get. Get a ton of eagles? Lean into the magic damage.
            Get a bunch of hunters? Add some Chus to the board and easily clear
            waves. If you're doing a hybrid like this, it's good to get Watt and
            save him for the final wave. If you're focusing physical, Vayne will
            clear all wave 80 bosses including Barrier. Regardless, check out the
            two builds and it'll be easier to choose your next mythics to level.
          </p>
          <p>Good Luck!</p>
