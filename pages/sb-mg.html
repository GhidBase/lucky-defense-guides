                        example, what they're saying is to clear hell mode you
                        need your Safe Box and Money Gun artifacts to both be at
                        least level 7.

                        How to get 100k+ gold using Safe Box
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        The basic idea is to avoid spending gold, and just
                        gamble for most of the first half of the game. The more
                        gold you have, the more money Safe Box gives you at the
                        end of a wave. How much gold can you get from this? Well
                        theoretically, let's say you have 100 gold. Let's also
                        say there are NO enemies being killed, so your only
                        source of gold is Safe Box every way. This is how much
                        money you would earn with Safe Box after 80 waves
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Level 1 SB - 4,956 gold</li>
                        <li>Level 2 SB - 7,247 gold</li>
                        <li>Level 3 SB - 10,579 gold</li>
                        <li>Level 4 SB - 15,415 gold</li>
                        <li>Level 5 SB - 22,423 gold</li>
                        <li>Level 6 SB - 32,559 gold</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        On top of this, you also get a lot of gold from
                        defeating enemies. If you can build up to at least 10k
                        gold by wave 30, you can start to spend a little bit
                        more on summons. Keep in mind that if you can hold back
                        on spending gold, this is where you're going to start
                        making way more gold off of the Safe Box artifact, so if
                        you don't
                        <b>need</b>
                        to spend it, I would try to save even past 10k. 10k is
                        good, 20k, 30k is better. Your goal is at least 100k by
                        wave 80. But why keep such a ridiculously large
                        stockpile of gold when you could spend it getting more
                        mythics?

                        How to get millions of damage with Money Gun
                    </h2>
                    <p>
                        At this point you can probably see where this is going.
                        Let's take another look at Money Gun so we can really
                        see what's going on here.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="max-width-img"
                        src="../pics/sb-mg/money-gun.png"
                    />
                    <p>
                        <strong>
                            "Increases the ATK by 0.91% of held coins"
                        </strong>
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I don't have the specific numbers on how much damage
                        Money Gun adds to damage yet. However, it becomes very
                        clear once you start getting 100k+ gold, that it
                        increases damage by a massive amount. If we assume the
                        damage is a specifically "0.91% x each gold coins held"
                        It would translate like this -
                    </p>
                    <p>100k gold x .91% = 910% damage</p>
                    <p>
                        If the damage translates like this you can increase your
                        damage by close to ten times the amount with 100k gold.
                        Knowing this, you can try to weigh out the options
                        better as you play the game. Spend a bunch of gold to
                        get a second batman right now? Or save gold for more
                        late game power?
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The last thing to consider, is that mythic damage
                        upgrades stack multiplicatively with your money gun
                        upgrades.
                    </p>
                    <img
                        class="max-width-img"
                        src="../pics/sb-mg/mythic-damage-upgrade.jpg"
                    />
                    <p>
                        So if you have 10k damage from the mythic damage
                        upgrade, it also gets this 910% damage bonus on top of
                        it. Using this, the information in

                        good <a href="./stun-guide.html">stun placement,</a> and
                        some practice, you can start to clear hard mode without
                        being carried. It can be hard, but if your teammate also
                        knows the fundamentals you will start clearing hard mode
                        all the time.
