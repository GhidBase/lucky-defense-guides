        <p>
            Sb/mg stands for "Safe Box and Money Gun". These are artifacts
            you can unlock with keys. When you see people
            say "You need at least 7/7 sb/mg for hell mode" for example,
            what they're saying is to clear hell mode you need your Safe
            Box and Money Gun artifacts to both be at least level 7.

        <h2 class="section-header">Why are these artifacts so powerful?</h2>
        <p>
            Safe Box and Money Gun synergize together in a way that can give
            you massive bonuses to you damage.  Below are pictures of these
            artifacts so you can see what they do
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">How to get 100k+ gold using Safe Box</h2>
        <p>
            The basic idea is to avoid spending gold, and just
            gamble for most of the first half of the game. The
            more gold you have, the more money Safe Box gives you
            at the end of a wave. How much gold can you get from this?
            Well theoretically, let's say you have 100 gold. Let's
            also say there are NO enemies being killed, so your only
            source of gold is Safe Box every way. This is how much
            money you would earn with Safe Box after 80 waves
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Level 1 SB - 4,956 gold</li>
            <li>Level 2 SB - 7,247 gold</li>
            <li>Level 3 SB - 10,579 gold</li>
            <li>Level 4 SB - 15,415 gold</li>
            <li>Level 5 SB - 22,423 gold</li>
            <li>Level 6 SB - 32,559 gold</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            On top of this, you also get a lot of gold from defeating
            enemies. If you can build up to at least 10k gold by wave
            30, you can start to spend a little bit more on summons.
            Still try to keep most of your gold for Safe Box growth
            if you don't <b>need</b> to be spending it. Why keep such
            a ridiculously large stockpile of gold when you could spend
            it getting more mythics?
