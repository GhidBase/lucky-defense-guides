        <p>
            Sb/mg stands for "Safe Box and Money Gun". These are artifacts
            you can unlock with keys. When you see people
            say "You need at least 7/7 sb/mg for hell mode" for example,
            what they're saying is to clear hell mode you need your Safe
            Box and Money Gun artifacts to both be at least level 7.

        <h2 class="section-header">Why are these artifacts so powerful?</h2>
        <p>
            Safe Box and Money Gun synergize together in a way that can give
            you massive bonuses to you damage.  Below are pictures of these
            artifacts so you can see what they do
        </p>

        <h2 class="section-header">How to get 100k+ gold using Safe Box</h2>
        <p>
            The basic idea is to avoid spending gold, and just
            gamble for most of the first half of the game. The
            more gold you have, the more money Safe Box gives you
            at the end of a wave. How much gold can you get from this?
            Well theoretically, let's say you have 100 gold. Let's
            also say there are NO enemies being killed, so your only
            source of gold is Safe Box every way. This is how much
            money you would earn with Safe Box after 80 waves
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Level 1 SB - 4,956 gold</li>
            <li>Level 2 SB - 7,247 gold</li>
            <li>Level 3 SB - 10,579 gold</li>
            <li>Level 4 SB - 15,415 gold</li>
            <li>Level 5 SB - 22,423 gold</li>
            <li>Level 6 SB - 32,559 gold</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            On top of this, you also get a lot of gold from defeating
            enemies. If you can build up to at least 10k gold by wave
            30, you can start to spend a little bit more on summons.
            Keep in mind that if you can hold back on spending gold,
            this is where you're going to start making way more gold
            off of the Safe Box artifact, so if you don't <b>need</b>
            to spend it, I would try to save even past 10k. 10k is good,
            20k, 30k is better. Your goal is at least 100k by wave 80.
            But why keep such a ridiculously large stockpile of gold
            when you could spend it getting more mythics?

        <h2 class="section-header">How to get millions of damage with Money Gun</h2>
        <p>
            At this point you can probably see where this is going. Let's
            take another look at Money Gun so we can really see what's
            going on here.
        </p>

        <p><strong>
            "Increases the ATK by 0.91% of held coins"
        </strong></p>

        <p>
            I don't have the specific numbers on how much damage Money Gun
            adds to damage yet. However, it becomes very clear once you start
            getting 100k+ gold, that it increases damage by a massive amount.
            If we assume the damage is a specifically "0.91% x each gold coins held"
            It would translate like this -
        </p>

        <p>
        100k gold x .91% = 910% damage
        </p>

        <p>
            If the damage translates like this you can increase your damage by
            close to ten times the amount with 100k gold. Knowing this, you can
            try to weigh out the options better as you play the game. Spend a
            bunch of gold to get a second batman right now? Or save gold
            for more late game power?
        </p>

        <p>
            The last thing to consider, is that mythic damage upgrades stack
            multiplicatively with your money gun upgrades.
        </p>

        <p>
            So if you have 10k damage from the mythic damage upgrade, it also
            gets this 910% damage bonus on top of it. Using this, the
            information in <a href="./defense-reduction.html">the defense reduction
            guide</a>, proper stun placement, and some practice, you can start to clear
            hard mode consistently. With a partner who knows all of this, you can even
            find hard mode to be easy!
