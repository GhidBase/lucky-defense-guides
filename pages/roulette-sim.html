                                to figure out what method is the cheapest way to

                            <h2>Roulette Spin Strategies</h2>
                            <p>
                                There's a bit of strategy to figuring out which
                                roulette to use. Epic roulette seems to be the
                                most efficient way to get legendaries. Run the
                                simulation on epic mode and on legendary mode
                                and you can compare the numbers.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Selling or Merging</h3>
                            <p>
                                Note that when you fail your gambles, you have a
                                15% chance to get a lower tier guardian because
                                of the Gambler's Wrist artifact. This means when
                                rolling legendary, you can get an epic, and when
                                rolling epic, you can get a rare. So you have to
                                decide what to do with them: do you sell your
                                Gambler's Wrist guardians, or do you save them
                                to merge later? The simulator lets you choose
                                either approach. Choose sell mode, and every
                                guardian from Gambler's Wrist will be sold for
                                luck stones. Epics will be sold for 2 stones,
                                rares will be sold for 1 stone. This does
                                simulate the Receipt artifact, but it's not
                                super impactful. Regardless, it'll track every
                                time the artifact procs, showing each proc in
                                both the Roulette Roll Log, and the Artifact
                                Details panel. If you choose merge, at the end
                                of the simulation it'll merge all the lower
                                tiers so they become the tier you were rolling
                                for.
                            </p>
                            <h3>Legendary Per Stone</h3>
                            <p>
                                Regardless of if you roll Rare, Epic, or
                                Legendary roulette, at the end of all your
                                rolls, the simulator will merge everything that
                                can be merged into the higher tiers. We will
                                divide the starting stone count by the number of
                                guardians of each tier to figure out how many
                                stones it cost to get each guardian. So this way
                                you can run the Rare, Epic, or Legendary
                                simulator, and it will tell you the average cost
                                of a Legendary using each of those methods, even
                                allowing you to see how using the sell or merge
                                strategy affects these numbers.

                            <h2>When to use Legendary Roulette</h2>
                            <p>
                                Based on what was said in this, you might assume
                                that legendary roulette is useless. Despite
                                these numbers, there are still two use cases for
                                it:
                            </p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Getting Legendaries as fast as possible</li>
                                <li>
                                    Getting Legendaries when you don't have
                                    space for epics
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                Particularly in hell mode, towards the end of
                                the game you're likely to start running out of
                                space on the board. You won't have space to have
                                5 types of epics anymore. You probably won't
                                even have space for 3 types of epics. At that
                                point, it's not realistic to do epic gamble. At
                                this point, it would likely be better to just
                                Legendary Roulette. Each Legendary will cost
                                about 1.5x more than doing Epic Roulette this
                                way, but it's much more realistic in that
                                situation than Epic Roulette.

                                Have fun messing with the simulator, I had a ton
                                of fun building it. I hope the information here
                                helps! -GhidWard
