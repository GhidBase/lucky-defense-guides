                    <h2>Should you do Epic Roulette or Legendary Roulette?</h2>
                    <p>
                        This Roulette Simulator was built with finding the best
                        use for your luck stones. If you only want to get the
                        most legendaries with as few luck stones as possible,
                        what is the most cost effective way to spend luck
                        stones?
                    </p>
                    <p>Your options are:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Rare Roulette Spin (60%)</li>
                        <li>Epic Roulette Spin (35%)</li>
                        <li>Legendary Roulette Spin (14.2%)</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>(these assume artifact level 6 for simplicity)</p>
                    <h2>Artifacts that affect your spins:</h2>
                    <p>
                        There are a couple artifacts that change the
                        effectiveness of each type of roulette spin.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Skull Stone - Has a 15% chance to refund the cost
                            when roulette summon fails
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Gamblers Wrist - Has 15% chance to gain lower tier
                            guardian when roulette summon fails
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Horn - Increases epic summon chance by 7.5% in the
                            roulette summon
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Golden Dice - Increases legendary summon chance by
                            4.2% in the roulette summon
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Receipt - Gains +1 luck stone by 4.5% when selling a
                            guardian
                        </li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Roulette Spin Strategies</h2>
                    <p>
                        There isn't much strategy at play with roulette spins
                        other than using the most efficient one. There is one
                        thing worth considering though: What do you do when you
                        get a lower rarity guardian from a failed spin, with the
                        Gambler's Wrist artifact? Do you save them to merge
                        later? Or do you sell them? You would also need to
                        consider that when you sell a guardian, you have a 4.5%
                        chance to gain an extra luck stone on top of the luck
                        stone(s) you normally get from selling.
