                Hard mode is very different from normal. On top of the normal
                waves and bosses, it comes with a Dungeon which you have to
                clear out in 16 minutes or lose. The enemies also have much more
                health than in normal and hence you have to scale your damage up
                much more quickly. This guide will cover what you need to pay
                attention to in each phase of Hard. It is also recommended to
                only attempt Hard from sb/mg 3/3 onwards.

              <p>At the start, your priorities are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Summon Bandits to build your coin economy</li>
                <li>Clear as many missions early as possible/li></li>
                <li>
                  Epic roulette to get some Epic guardians and stuns on the
                  board
                </li>
                <li>Get 1-2 DPS mythics</li>
              </ul>
              <h1>Summon Bandits to build your coin economy</h1>

              <p>
                Bandits are the other pillar of your coin economy next to sb.
                Their Loot skills is what helps you to gain more coins, besides
                killing enemies and completing missions which reward coins. Your
                Bandit should at least be level 6. Ideally level 15 but
                preferably level 9+ for the +10% attack speed.
              </p>
              <p>
                You ideally want to summon 6 Bandits. If you’re lucky enough to
                get more than 6, good for you. But you need to decide on a
                summon cost to stop summoning because nonstop summoning will
                obviously kill your coin economy. My recommendation is stop at
                80-cost unless you have less than 3 bandits, then summon till
                you hit 3. More conservative players suggest stopping at
                60-cost. You have to decide what works for you.
              </p>
              <p>
                Once you summon Bandits, send them into the Dungeon where there
                is a boss for them to beat on constantly and trigger their Loot
                skill. If you leave them on the main board, they’ll be idling
                25% of the time. If you only summoned 6 Bandits, there will be
                one empty space where you can send your DPS later on to clear
                the Dungeon while your Bandits continue to farm coins.
              </p>

              <h1>Clear as many missions early as possible</h1>

              <p>
                Clearing as many missions as possible is crucial for earning
                luck stones early for the next tip for this phase and for
                getting coins early to do your coin summons to get your Bandits.
                The missions you want to rush are:
              </p>

              <ol>
                <li>
                  Blacksmith (Upgrade 2x): Immediately upgrade Common and Epic
                  once each. This gives you a net gain in coins for completing
                  the mission, one luck stone from the Lamp artifact, and more
                  damage for your Epic guardians to take down the golems and W10
                  bosses.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Summon all Commons: You should get this along the way to
                  summoning 6 Bandits.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Sell 5 Guardians: If you have not gotten enough epic guardians
                  for the next mission by W6, sell 5 units you don’t want to get
                  that extra luck stone to attempt another epic roulette. If you
                  have more than 5 units you don’t want, merge until you only
                  have 5 units you don’t want. If you can merge 3 Rares into an
                  Epic, do that. Otherwise, sell 5 and spam Epic roulette.
                  <b
                    >Do not sell or merge Shock Robots unless you have more than
                    6.</b
                  >
                </li>
                <li>
                  Successfully hunt Golem before W10: How many Epic guardians
                  you need to make this work depends on the level of your Epic
                  guardians. If they’re level 15, you just need one with your 1
                  Epic upgrade. If they’re 12, you will need 2-3 between
                  yourself and your teammate. If they’re below 12 then you
                  either need more or may need to upgrade Epic another time.
                  Regardless, make sure you can kill the first golem for the
                  mission.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collect 10 Luck Stones: Seems counterintuitive but this
                  mission is actually easy once you figure it out. The previous
                  golem mission gives you 1 luck stone. Each golem killed gives
                  you another 2 luck stones each for a total of 5 luck stones.
                  If you have enough DPS to kill the golems, you have enough to
                  kill the W10 bosses. Don’t spend any luck stones until after
                  killing the W10 bosses. That’ll net you another 4 luck stones.
                  If you get the early kill bonus, that’s another luck stone
                  which tallies to 10 luck stones. If you fall slightly short,
                  just sell a rare or two to hit 10.
                </li>
                <li>
                  Collect 1,000 coins: At some point you should have stopped
                  summoning, whether it is at 6 Bandits, 80-summon cost or 3
                  Bandits with summon cost above 80. Thereafter you should be
                  able to complete this before W20.
                </li>
              </ol>

              <h1>
                Epic roulette to get some Epic guardians and stuns on the board
              </h1>
              <p>
                Epic guardians will be your main DPS contributors until you get
                your first DPS mythic up. As suggested above, use Epic roulette
                summon till you have enough Epic guardians to kill the golems
                (and by extension W10 bosses). If you are out of luck stones and
                still need more damage to kill the first golems, upgrade your
                epic level once or twice. After the collect 10 luck stones
                mission, spend all your luck stones to summon Epics to try to
                merge to a Legendary.
              </p>
              <p>
                You need stuns unless you plan to whale on immortals to cheese
                through Hard. Keep your Electro Robots and Shock Robots unless
                you have at least 3x Electro Robots and 3x Shock Robots
                remaining after merging. Before the lategame you should ideally
                have 3x Electro Robots and 6x Shock Robots.
              </p>

                />
              </div>

              <h1>Get 1-2 DPS mythics</h1>
              <p>
                Unless your Epic guardians are all maxed at level 15 and you
                have a whole bunch of them. you’ll need DPS mythics to kill the
                W20 bosses. That’s how fast the hp scales up in Hard. W10
                bosses? Killable with 1-3 Epics depending on guardian level and
                upgrades. W20 bosses? Either 10+ Epics wailing on it till 10s
                left or a DPS mythic. And even with the DPS mythic you may not
                get the early kill bonus if your stuns are not set up properly.
              </p>
              <p>
                Secondly, there is the Dungeon to deal with. When you get to
                sb5+, you have the luxury of waiting till W30 to start clearing
                the Dungeon before it ends at ~W42-44. When you just start, you
                need all the time you can get to kill the 5 Dungeon bosses.
              </p>
              <p>
                That’s why you ideally want at least 2 DPS mythics so one can
                focus on the Dungeon and the other can clear waves and bosses on
                the main board. Between you and your teammate you will want 2-3
                DPS mythics but people can be prone to bad RNG on roulettes and
                legendary merges. Or bad teammates in quick matches.
              </p>
              <p>The DPS mythics which help in the early game are:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>Sheriff → Hailey 6</li>
                <li>War Machine → Chu 6</li>
                <li>Storm Giant → Tao 12 / Vayne 6 (Vayne is Dungeon only)</li>
                <li>Tiger Master → Kun 6</li>
              </ul>
            </div>

              <h1>Continue to increase damage output</h1>
              <p>
                In this phase, the priority is taking down Dungeon and
                increasing your Mythic DPS output. This can be rolling for a 2nd
                to 4th DPS, or upgrading mythic level damage so that your
                existing DPS mythics deal more damage. Often, upgrading a few
                levels of mythic damage will help your single DPS clear the
                Dungeon in time while allowing you to keep 2 spots for your
                Bandits.
              </p>
              <h1>Build up your supports</h1>
              <p>
                Once you have enough DPS mythics, it is then also time to start
                building your support board. Monos and Kitties for luck stone
                generation and MP Regen. Attack speed increase to increase
                overall board effectiveness. Defense reduction for physical DPS
                (both yours and your teammate’s) should be at least 180 and
                preferably 200 by W80.
              </p>
              <p>
                After you take down the W40 boss, make sure to clear the Dungeon
                before the timer runs out. With that you will enter the
                late-game phase of Hard.
              </p>
              <h1>Burning eco to save your game</h1>
              <p>
                It's inevitable. Sometimes luck is bad and gets in the way of
                you setting up your ideal board. Maybe you have bad RNG on
                getting stuns. Maybe your Chus keep exploding. Maybe you have a
                5% Epic Roulette summon rate.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you still don't have a DPS mythic by W25, you need to
                consider maxing summon level and burning coins on summons to
                squeeze out a Legendary to get your DPS mythic.
              </p>
              <p>Danger signs for when you might need to burn coins:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There was less than 20 seconds left when killing the previous
                  boss and neither side has gotten a new DPS mythic
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mob count hovers around 60+ for a prolonged period or
                  continues increasing when above 60
                </li>
                <li>
                  You or your teammate was relying on only base Chu and/or Frog
                  for DPS and just exploded it

            <div class="tab-body">
              <p>
                Once in the late-game, you need to assess your board to make a
                very important decision. What Legendary do you want to pick from
                the W50 boss reward to help you clear Hard?
              </p>
              <p>
                Here are some statistics to help understand how much Hard ramps
                up in the late-game:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  At W60 (including taking down the boss), total damage dealt
                  would be at least 1.5 trillion
                </li>
                <li>
                  At W70 (including taking down the boss), total damage dealt
                  would be at least 4.5 trillion. That means twice as much
                  damage has to be dealt in these 10 waves as the first 60
                  waves.
                </li>
                <li>
                  At W80 (including taking down the final boss), total damage
                  dealt would be at least 13 trillion. That’s nearly triple the
                  damage from W1-70, and over 8 times the damage from W1-60.
                </li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                A lot of that health will be from the bosses. So you need to be
                confident of dealing enough damage to the bosses. With that in
                mind, the following scenarios are in order of highest priority
                first:
              </p>
              <h1>Burning eco to save your game</h1>
              <p>
                It's inevitable. Sometimes luck is bad and gets in the way of
                you setting up your ideal board. Maybe you have bad RNG on
                getting stuns. Maybe your Chus keep exploding. Maybe you have a
                5% Epic Roulette summon rate.
              </p>
              <p>
                If you still don't have a DPS mythic by W25, you need to
                consider maxing summon level and burning coins on summons to
                squeeze out a Legendary to get your DPS mythic.
              </p>
              <p>Danger signs for when you might need to burn coins:</p>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  There was less than 20 seconds left when killing the previous
                  boss and neither side has gotten a new DPS mythic
                </li>
                <li>
                  Mob count hovers around 60+ for a prolonged period or
                  continues increasing when above 60
                </li>
                <li>
                  You or your teammate was relying on only base Chu and/or Frog
                  for DPS and just exploded it
                </li>
              </ul>
              <h1>Not enough coin economy</h1>
              <p>
                You want to aim for 300k+ coins by W80. For sb3, that’s at least
                30k coins at W40 or 40k coins at W45. That’s a very tall task
                and largely depends on whether you get a good number of Bandits
                at the start. If you don’t have enough, you will face issues
                killing the W70/W80 bosses.
              </p>
              <p>
                To overcome this, you will need to summon Lances and Kitties to
                deal enough damage to the bosses. For W50, you should pick
                Sheriff (75% chance to appear). With Lance 6, that’s 3 Lances
                with active swapping of the third Lance in when the ult is
                ready. Minimum 4+ Kitty Mages within range for their ult to
                benefit the Lances. With Lance 12, 2 Lances will be sufficient.
              </p>
              <p>
                With this strategy, your stunlock must be solid to have no
                leaks. That is minimum 3 Electro Robots and 6 Shock Robots on
                each side, mirroring each other in location to maximise stuns.
                Make sure this is in place as early as possible.
              </p>
              <p>
                Have this set up and you will deal enough damage to take down
                the bosses.
              </p>
              <h1>Slightly short on coin economy, have Awakened Hailey</h1>
              <p>
                If you fall slightly short on coins but have Awakened Hailey
                (immortal form) unlocked, try to rush a Awakened Hailey out. If
                you don’t have a Hailey yet, go for Sheriff on W50 (75% chance
                to appear). After your coin passes 50k, max summon level and
                summon to have Hailey reach max Star Power and to build up your
                support board.
              </p>
              <p>
                If possible, have 3 Kitties next to your Hailey to boost her MP
                Regen with their ults to maximise the chances of summoning
                Awakening Hailey.
              </p>
              <h1>Good coin economy</h1>
              <p>
                If you do have enough coins, use the W50 reward to summon
                another DPS mythic of your choice. Between you and your
                teammate, you should have 5-6 DPS mythics combined. Focus on
                upgrading mythic damage after and filling out your support
                board.
              </p>
              <p>
                Only spend coins if you will still have at least 300k by W80.
                The thresholds at various checkpoints are:
              </p>
              <ul>
                <li>W40: 30k coins</li>
                <li>W45: 40k coins</li>
                <li>W50: 55k coins</li>
                <li>W60: 95k coins</li>
                <li>W70: 170k coins</li>
              </ul>
              <p>
                Max your summon level before spending coins to maximise the
                number of luck stones from selling excess rares, epics and
                legendaries to use to upgrade your mythic damage. Remember to
                keep support units you need (eg. Eagles for attack speed
                increase, Hunters for defense reduction for Physical DPS).
              </p>
              <p>
                Alternatively if you have access to Indy 6+ and don’t have a
                good spot to place another DPS mythic, consider getting a
                Sheriff for an Indy. If you are lucky on the treasure dug up
                from his ult, you can get a massive buff. Aim for the luck stone
                per wave, attack speed increase, and (if you have Physical
                DPSes) defense reduction buffs.
