          <h2>Help I'm New! Guide Quests</h2>
          <p>
            For new players, the game has a series of tutorial quests to help
            players learn the mechanics of the game. Here we will talk about the
            importance of each activity to your gameplay in the tutorial quests.
            Each tutorial quest has to be completed in Coop mode and within a
            single game. Completing one will unlock the next stage.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 1: Upgrade guardians 8 times</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 90 Invitations</i></p>
          <p><img class="max-width-img" src="../pics/quests/quest1.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            This quest counts whether you have upgrading guardian damage
            in-game. It does not count upgrading your summon level. Upgrading
            guardian’s damage in-game is important to deal enough damage to get
            through the waves. From the mid-game onwards, you will be spending
            some of your mythic stones on upgrading your mythic damage level so
            that your mythic DPS guardians deal more damage.
          </p>
          <p>
            In the early game, the Blacksmith mission (upgrade 2 times) can also
            be completed with a net gain in gold by upgrading common damage
            level once and epic damage level once.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 2: Merge guardians 10 times</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 10,000 Gold</i></p>
          <p><img class="max-width-img" src="../pics/quests/quest2.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            Merging guardians is done by having 3 of the same guardian (epic or
            lower) which can then be merged using the merge button to get you a
            random guardian one tier higher (common -> rare -> epic ->
            legendary). Merging guardians is important to make use of the excess
            common guardians you will get early on, and especially important for
            merging epics into legendaries to be able to summon DPS mythics.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 3: Clear Missions 5 times</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 5 Artifact Keys</i></p>
          <p><img class="max-width-img" src="../pics/quests/quest3.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            Missions in-game will reward you with gold or luck stone(s). With
            the Luck Stone artifact, each mission you complete will give you
            bonus luck stones (level 1-5: 1 bonus luck stone, level 6-10: 2
            bonus luck stones, level 11: 3 bonus luck stones). Completing
            missions in the early game is important to gain luck stones to spend
            on epic roulette summons for building up your board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Bear in mind the collect 10 luck stones mission. The early golem
            mission plus 2 golems will be 5 luck stones. Killing the 2 W10
            bosses and before 30s for the early kill bonus luck stone will net
            you another 5. The Lamp artifact will also give you a luck stone at
            W10. You can spend all your other luck stones before this to summon
            epics to be able to kill the golems and the W10 boss. Once you
            complete the 10 luck stone mission you can spend all your luck
            stones on epic roulettes.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 4: Summon guardians with luck stones 6 times</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: Lancelot x1 (Mythic Guardian)</i></p>
          <p><img class="max-width-img" src="../pics/quests/quest4.jpg" /></p>
          <p>
            Roulette summoning (ie. using luck stones to summon guardians) is an
            integral part of the gameplay. You have to learn to use roulette
            summoning for much of the game to be able to build up your coin
            stash with the Safe Box artifact (sb) to get a significant ATK boost
            from the Money Gun artifact (mg).
          </p>
          <p>
            This quest is something you should be capable of doing every single
            game. And the reward being Lancelot set you up nicely for attempting
            hard when you reach sb3.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 5: Summon a Mythic guardian 2 times</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 20 Mythic Stones</i></p>

          <p>
            Mythic guardians are going to be the mainstay of your board aside
            from your stunners and the occasional immortal. This quest is to
            encourage you to lean into the habit of relying primarily on mythics
            to build up your board.
          </p>
          <p>
            Take note that not all mythics are worth summoning! Check out the
            <a href="https://luckydefenseguides.com/pages/normal-mode.html"
              >Ultimate Normal Guide</a
            >
            for our recommendations for DPS mythics.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 6: Move guardians to recommended tiles 5 times</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 1,000 Diamonds</i></p>

          <p>
            There are recommended positions for each guardian. Knowing where to
            place them to best maximise their utility is important.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 7: Stun Bosses for 50 seconds or more</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 30 Mythic Stones</i></p>

          <p>
            Stun is hugely important. Knowing how to stun enemies to keep them
            in the kill zone. Knowing where to place your stuns. Knowing how
            much stuns is needed between both players. Most new players often
            don’t keep enough stun on the board. The recommended amount is 3x
            Electro Robots and 6x Shock Robots per player.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 8: Achieve 80 Def Reduction</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: Safe Box x1 (Artifact)</i></p>

          <p>
            Defense reduction is important to enable physical DMG DPSes to
            continue dealing damage as the enemies’ DEF increases with each
            wave. Check out the
            <a

              Defense Reduction Guide </a
            >for a more detailed explanation.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reward, a Safe Box artifact, is also hugely important. Read the
            <a href="https://luckydefenseguides.com/pages/sb-mg.html"
              >sb/mg guide </a
            >to understand why.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 9: Earn 100 coins with Bandit’s Loot skill</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 20,000 Gold</i></p>

          <p>
            Farming coins is really important for sb/mg ATK boosting. Bandit’s
            Loot skill is the primary means of farming coins early on before
            sb’s effect dwarfs it once your coins reach sizeable levels. You
            ideally want to aim for 6-9 Bandits on the board farming coins for
            you in the early game, but don’t summon beyond 80 summon cost (or 60
            if you’re more conservative). If you’re unlucky on Bandits, you just
            have to settle for how many you have and let them farm whatever
            coins they can for you.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 10: Earn 500 coins from the Safe Box Effect</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: Money Gun x1 (Artifact)</i></p>

          <p>
            Earning 500 coins from Safe Box should be easy enough as long as you
            aren’t burning away all your gold all the time. Money Gun is the
            other half of the vital sb/mg combo and this quest reward unlocks
            that combo.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 11: Achieve 40 ATK from Money Gun Effect</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 50 Mythic Stones</i></p>

          <p>
            This quest points you towards using mg to boost your ATK. If you
            haven’t already, read the
            <a
              href="guide https://luckydefenseguides.com/pages/sb-mg.html
            "
            >
              sb/mg </a
            >to understand the importance.
          </p>
          <br />
          <h3>Stage 12: Reach Lancelot’s skill level 6 (via luck stones)</h3>
          <p><i>Reward: 10 Artifact Keys</i></p>

          <p>
            This quest is unusual as Lance is pretty useless in Normal. However,
            he will be vital in helping to clear Hard mode when your sb is low
            (ie. sb3-4). In Hard, you will want to max out his Flame skill level
            before the later waves so he deals maximum %-based damage with his
            skills.
