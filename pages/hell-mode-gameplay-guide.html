                        Hell mode is the next difficulty after Hard and it is a
                        very big jump from the previous mode. In this mode there
                        is no dungeon which means less space for summoning
                        units. Bosses are much harder to kill and special bosses
                        appear at waves 30, 60 and 80. The special bosses which
                        can appear are:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Night Shaman</li>
                        <li>Coldest</li>

                        The total damage you need to deal to clear Hell is 10x
                        (130 trillion) the damage needed to clear Hard (13
                        trillion). That should give you an idea of how much
                        stronger you have to be to clear Hell.

                                (Minimum) Without Lance 12, you need to either
                                have higher sb (sb7+) to attempt Hell or
                                multiple immortals that you know how to
                                consistently summon to keep up in the late-game
                                to make any meaningful contribution to killing
                                bosses.

                                (Recommended) Still Lance 12. There’s no need to
                                level Lance beyond level 12. Separately, it
                                would be beneficial to get Lance’s exclusive
                                treasure to save on the luck stones needed to
                                max Lance’s Flame (increase hp % damage) passive
                                skill.

                            <p>
                                (Minimum) At minimum your Safe Box artifact has
                                to be level 5+ in order to have any chance of
                                accumulating enough coins for your DPS to deal
                                sufficient damage in the late-game or to spam
                                summons to get enough Lances and Kitties out.
                                Even at sb5 you will be relying almost
                                exclusively on Lance 12 to be able to kill
                                bosses. Reaper Dian can kill bosses in Hell but
                                not if you ruin your economy to summon him.
                            </p>

                                Money Gun level 5+ is for your DPS to be able to
                                keep up with the scaling of health of the enemy
                                waves and bosses.

                                (Recommended) Ideally you should be sb/mg 6/6
                                which enables you to more consistently
                                accumulate enough coins and for the mg ATK boost
                                to be better for your DPS to deal sufficient
                                damage for the late-game. The higher your Luck
                                Stone artifact, the more consistent your early
                                game becomes as you get more luck stones from
                                completing early missions to do epic roulette
                                summons.

                                (Minimum) Your epic guardians are going to be
                                your primary damage dealers in the early game.
                                In order for them to deal sufficient damage to
                                stay alive early on, you need them to at least
                                be level 12. Even at level 12 you may need to
                                upgrade epic damage level in-game to keep up
                                with the increasing mob hp.

                                should be at level 15 before you attempt Hell.

                                The mission list in Hell is slightly different
                                from the Hard mission list. Notably the
                                following missions are not in Hell:
                            </p>
                            <ul>

                            </ul>
                            <p>The following missions are made harder:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>Sell 10 Guardians (up from 5)</li>
                                <li>
                                    Successfully hunt Golem before W8 (was W10
                                    in Hard)
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>
                                There is only 1 new mission (Flashback), which
                                is coming back from having 99 enemies on the
                                board. Due to this new mission, the optimal
                                start to the game is to clear this mission
                                immediately at the beginning. Wait for mobs to
                                reach a number of 90-97(units have to pass 99)
                                to start spamming summons. When exactly to start
                                summoning depends on the level of your common
                                and rare units. If they are maxed at 15, you can
                                start at 95-97. If they are low level, you
                                probably want to start summoning at 90 to avoid
                                dying from having too many mobs on the field.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                The Golem Hunt mission is a lot harder to
                                accomplish now since it has to be done before
                                W8. Considering the first golem is summoned
                                mid-W6 at earliest and the golems take a bit of
                                time to walk to the middle, you need substantial
                                firepower to take down the golems in time. It is
                                recommended for at least 4 epics combined
                                between your teammate and you to kill the golems
                                in time.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you didn’t get any, try merging units and
                                selling all Rares you don’t need. Otherwise,
                                upgrade epic damage level to make up quantity
                                with quality.
                            </p>

                                There’s no escaping it, you still need to summon
                                Bandits early to get your coin economy going.
                                The difference is you no longer have a Dungeon
                                to throw your Bandits into to be attacking 24/7.
                                You have to manage the positioning of your units
                                to maximise the amount of time your Bandits are
                                attacking. That means your stronger units should
                                not be killing mobs before they can reach your
                                Bandits.

                                The board below is a suggested way to arrange
                                your Bandits and damage dealers to avoid
                                disrupting your Bandits at least until W20.
                                Beyond W20 the mobs will have more than enough
                                health that you can move your epic guardians
                                closer to the left. Mythic DPS should be kept
                                behind (ie. column 4 or 5) until after W30.

                                Penguin Musician is recommended to boost the
                                attack speed of your Bandits with its active
                                skill (10% chance to increase ATK SPD by 20% for
                                3s) to farm coins more quickly and also benefits
                                your DPSes. If you use Penguin, keep it at level
                                1. Penguin does not need to be levelled up.

                                on epic roulette and need to survive longer
                                using epics. This will only work until max W29.
                                By the W30 boss, you must have a DPS mythic.
                                Even the W20 boss can be problematic if you
                                don’t have enough epics or epic damage upgrades.

                                temptation to merge Electro Robots when you get
                                a full stack. Do not do that as stuns are just
                                as important for survival. If you have 5+
                                Electro Robots though, you can consider to merge
                                a 3x stack to try for a DPS mythic. A lack of
                                stuns is guaranteed to lose you the game.

                                Robots remaining after merging. By late-game,
                                you should ideally have 3x Electro Robots and 6x

                                The mid-game is where you start to see the
                                difference from Hard. Instead of a Dungeon to
                                take down, you have to start planning for
                                special bosses. It is also important to
                                differentiate between wave clear DPS and boss
                                killer DPS. You will need boss killers to beat
                                Hell at least until you hit sb7. For more info,

                                like the other modes.

                                For 2x speed users, it is highly recommended to
                                remove 2x speed before the special boss waves
                                (W30/W60/W80), so you have more time to react.
                                Especially for Reaper, Magician and Night
                                Shaman. Even if you think you can time it
                                correctly, you may get your teammate’s board
                                destroyed. So do the sensible thing and turn off
                                2x before special bosses.

                                but we will still highlight certain bosses which
                                tend to be more problematic.

                                Draws a magic circle on random spaces, and
                                instantly mutates the unit in those spaces into
                                another random unit. The mutation is chosen from
                                the same rarity of the original unit. This boss
                                can mess up your carefully built board,
                                especially if it appears at W60 or W80.

                                The mutation happens too quickly to always
                                escape it but you can try to save your two most
                                important units by swapping them from opposite
                                ends of the board 1s after the Night Shaman
                                spawns with the red ring. Even that is not
                                guaranteed as they will still get mutated if
                                they are passing over a space targeted by the
                                Night Shaman when the mutation happens.

                                Shaman’s mutation.

                            units on those squares will be destroyed.

                                seconds, a meteor will rain down on the unit(s)
                                in that square and destroy it. Green warning =

                                immortal guardians. You will have a few seconds
                                to move your units away from the red circled
                                spots after they appear so be vigilant. During
                                the late-game, you may have too full a board to
                                save all your units. In which case, plan for
                                which units you will sacrifice when the time
                                comes.

                                Has low hp but has a shield equal to 10x its hp.

                                Lances, you cannot beat it. It tends to have

                                though so you might be able to beat it still
                                with sufficient wave clear DPSes.

                                To answer this question, you have to know your
                                desired end state. At the end-game, you’re
                                aiming for 700k+ coins (ideally 800k+), mythic
                                level 14+ and 4-6 DPS (with at least 2 boss
                                killers). If you don’t have sufficient luck
                                stone income from Monos or Indy to reach mythic
                                level 14+, you will need to coin summon on maxed
                                summon level to get units to sell for luck
                                stones. If you don’t have enough DPSes, you will
                                also need to coin summon to get legendaries
                                (either by luck or through merging epics) to get
                                more DPSes.

                                the desired end state. Hence sb5 in Hell is
                                primarily dependent on Lance 12 for boss killing
                                with full stun setup, 4+ Kitties for support,
                                Awakened Hailey and 1-2 wave clear DPS. You
                                still want to have at least 400-500k coins at

                                If you’ve managed to save 40k coins by W40,
                                you’re doing fairly alright but don’t spend your
                                coins just yet. If your coin total is lower than
                                40k coins at W40, you want to try to postpone
                                your summoning as late as possible to let sb
                                grow your coin stash a little more.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                If you want to start maxing your Hailey’s Star
                                Power or you need a bit more firepower for W50,
                                you can plan to max your summon level and start
                                summoning a few waves before (ie. W46+).
                                Hopefully you have 60k-80k coins before you
                                start spending.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                You’ll have to assess whether you need to summon
                                to beat the W50 boss depending on your
                                teammate’s and your board. But you will have to
                                be fully prepared for W60 as that’s late-game
                                and you cannot survive if your board isn’t
                                ready. Hence you have to be ready to start
                                summoning a few waves before W60 at latest.

                                DPS alone is not enough. Your DPSes need their
                                supports to function optimally. That’s MP Regen
                                for MP-based ult-dependent DPSes, DEF reduction
                                for physical DPSes, and attack speed for all
                                DPSes.

                                (especially when trying to summon Awakened
                                Hailey) and Monos benefit heavily from MP Regen.
                                Reaper Dian and Tao both also benefit from MP
                                Regen but not significantly.

                                by W80 for your Physical DPSes to boost your
                                physical damage output. If you have Ato and/or
                                Orc Shaman built up, their skills also boost
                                physical damage.

                                better. But make sure you don’t burn too much
                                coin and lose excessive mg ATK boost just to get
                                a few more % of attack speed increase. Ideally
                                50% ASI and Penguin but potentially much more
                                with Indy.

                            <ul>

                                    immortal summon condition

                                summon level and do some coin summons for more
                                Mythic units. After your board is finished, you
                                can put all surplus Lucky Stones you get to
                                Legendary/Mythic damage level up.

                                Aim for Mythic damage upgrade 14+ by W80. For

                                sb6+. That said, if you don’t have enough DPSes
                                out, keep summoning for them. 3 DPSes vs 2 is a
                                50% increase. 4 DPSes vs 3 is a 33% increase.
                                You want at least 4 DPSes (with 2 boss killers)
                                in the late game.
                            </p>

                                Attack speed increase of at least +30-50% is
                                good to have. Coupled with Penguin's active
                                skill, it will boost your DPS significantly.

                                Be very careful of the W60 boss. If it is a
                                Night Shaman, Grim Reaper or Magician, it stands
                                the chance of ruining your board such that you
                                can't deal with the W70 and W80 bosses. Remember
                                to swap your guardians away from the target
                                zones for Grim Reaper and Magician. Choose which
                                units will have to be sacrificed if there isn't
                                enough space.

                                DPS is important but support multiplies your
                                DPS. Get the attack speed increase, MP Regen,
                                DEF reduction or Atos that you need to help your
                                DPS do their job better. Some people leave their
                                Bandits till late (W65-70). That’s an option but
                                make sure to merge them by W70 to have time to
                                fill up your unit capacity with supports.

                                Stack Watt (250+ energy) until you get to the

                                easily, that’s the main reason Watt is so useful
                                in Hell. If you struggle in the final stages of
                                the game, you can pop him even earlier, but it
                                is not preferable since all those stacks would
                                go away (unless you have his exclusive Treasure)
                                and even then it is usually not worth it to
                                trigger Watt early.

                                Lance’s Flame passive skill should be maxed by
                                the end of the game. If you struggle with Lucky
                                Stones to max your Lance(s), summon units on
                                maxed summon upgrade to sell for stones to max

                                Unlike the W30 and W60 special bosses, the
                                special boss you get on W80 is unknown to you
                                until it appears on the board. And the final
                                boss can be different for each side. It is
                                absolutely possible for a W80 Night Shaman, Grim
                                Reaper or Magician to wreck your board so be
                                vigilant and follow the same precautions you
                                have done for the W30 and W60 bosses. A reminder
                                that immortal guardians are immune to the
                                effects of Night Shaman so you can focus on
                                saving your mythic guardians instead.
                            </p>

                            <p>
                                Make sure your board is ready to trap the two
                                bosses in the midlane and keep them stunlocked
                                so they won't trigger their special a second
                                time. If you are using Watt, remember to trigger
                                his ult. If you're using Lances, make sure to
                                have them next to where the bosses are stunned,
                                with your Kitty Mages below them.

                            <h1>Epilogue: What about immortals?</h1>
                            <p>
                                Immortals can be as strong as 2-3 mythics of the
                                same role (boss killer, wave clear, support).
                                However, bear in mind that immortals have their
                                own in-game summon conditions which can be
                                difficult to attain consistently. You can count
                                your summoned immortals as multiples of the
                                required roles they can fulfil in the endgame
                                board, but the required roles do not change.
