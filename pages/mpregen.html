          <h2>MP Regen</h2>
          <p>
            MP Regen is one of the buffs shared with your teammate. Shared team
            buffs are shown as icons under the board.
          </p>
          <div class="center-text">
            <img src="../pics/mpregen/mpregen.jpg" alt="" class="stretch-img" />
          </div>
          <p>
            MP Regen affects guardians who have MP-type ultimate skills (as
            opposed to cooldown type ults). When the guardian has gained enough
            MP, shown by their blue bar filling up, they will be able to use
            their ultimate. Guardians recharge 1 MP per second and 1 MP per
            attack.
          </p>
          <p>
            MP ultimates either cost 100, 200 or 300 MP to use. Note that Kitty
            Mage's ultimate actually gives flat MP instead of a percentage. So
            it fills the bar by a lower percentage for ults that cost 200 or 300
            MP.
          </p>
          <p>
            MP Regen is incremental so every % helps. There is no cut-off or
            rounding.
          </p>
          <p>
            MP Regen is especially important for guardians whose ult is
            important to them:
            <ul>
              <li>Lance: His ult triggers his % health damage passive skill 10 times, dealing up to 22% (or 33% if Lance 12) of the enemy’s health when fully upgraded.</li>
              <li>Mono: His ult executes a normal enemy to give you 1 luck stone.</li>
              <li>Hailey (with Awakened Hailey): The ability to summon Hailey’s immortal form is a percentage-based chance every time she uses her ult while having max (10) Star Power. More frequent ults mean getting Awakened Hailey sooner.</li>
              <li>Indy: The ult is to dig up a treasure that provides buffs. More ults mean more chances to reroll to a treasure you want.</li>
              <li>Kun: His ult gains him a buff between +1 to +99 that increases his ATK. More ults mean more chances to reroll to a high buff.</li>
            </ul>
