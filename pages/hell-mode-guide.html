            <h2 class="section-header">Wave Strategy</h2>

            <h3>Wave 1-2</h3>
            <p>Don't summon anything.</p>

            <h3>Wave 3</h3>
            <p>Spam summon immediately upon entering Wave 3. If you have sb5 or 6, you can upgrade summon level once.</p>

            <h3>Mob 99</h3>
            <p>When it reaches the 99 cap, flashback is triggered. If you and your teammate lack any epic or legendary units, upgrade common-rare levels (1-2) based on the number of rares available, then resume summoning. Merge, sell, and gamble until you obtain an epic. (Consider upgrading epic to level 2 if it's a tree, as its attack is slower.)</p>

            <h3>Wave 6</h3>
            <p>Hunt becomes available. Upgrade epic level to 2 or 3. Complete the hunt before Wave 7 ends to claim the reward.</p>

            <h3>Wave 10</h3>
            <p>Upgrade epics to level 3 if needed. A stun ability is helpful at this stage.</p>

            <h3>Wave 15</h3>
            <p>The third hunt unlocks. Upgrade epics to level 3 or 4 to succeed in hunting and preparing for Wave 19.</p>

            <h3>Wave 18</h3>
            <p>With only epics, you can't surpass Wave 20. You’ll need to get either Batman or Overclocked Chu before Wave 20. These can carry you to Wave 40 unless debuffed by Doctor or Coldest. If unavailable, upgrade summon to level 7 and spend all gold to obtain one. Save two throwers and a tree for later.</p>

            <h3>Wave 21</h3>
            <p>It’s advantageous to have 6-9 bandits for gold generation, and 3 Shock and 3 Electro Robots. Avoid summoning frogs (for sb < 6). Instead, summon mono for luck and defense reduction benefits for Batman, Chu, and Vayne.</p>

            <h3>Wave 31</h3>
            <p>Prepare kitties and aim for 200% MP. Have 1-2 Gravitons ready to stun and prevent the boss from attacking again. Merge hunters last for lance and defense debuffs, and keep a few eagles or tigers for attack speed.</p>

            <h3>Wave 36</h3>
            <p>Maximize summon level and spend gold to acquire at least two lances before Wave 40.</p>

            <h3>Wave 41</h3>
            <p>Continue finding at least four lances from this point. Don’t worry about conserving gold; the money gun loses effectiveness after this wave.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Boss Guide</h2>

            <h3>Bandit</h3>
            <p>Steals 30% of your money with each cast. Two bandits together take 50% of your money.</p>

            <h3>Shaman</h3>
            <p>Draws a magic circle to mutate units in selected squares to random ones of the same rank. Move units promptly to avoid mutation, though timing is strict.</p>

            <h3>Coldest</h3>
            <p>Targets a unit and inflicts a 20-wave debuff that reduces attack speed. Replace any affected stun units.</p>

            <h3>Magician</h3>
            <p>Red warning: casts a red circle on random squares, then rains a meteor that destroys the units within. Green warning: periodically self-heals.</p>

            <h3>Reaper</h3>
            <p>Displays a red circle on units, then destroys them after a few seconds. Prioritize protection for lance, stun, kitty, and bird/tiger. Batman can be abandoned after Wave 50.</p>

            <h3>Doctor</h3>
            <p>Inflicts a blindness debuff on a unit for 10 waves, causing occasional attack misses. Replace any affected stun units.</p>

            <h3>Slime</h3>
            <p>Periodically self-heals.</p>

            <h3>Barrier</h3>
            <p>Applies a shield covering 80-90% of max HP. Requires three level 13+ Batman for Wave 40.</p>

            <h3>Grunt</h3>
            <p>Takes reduced physical damage. Summon additional lances early if encountered in Wave 40 (Batman is ineffective here).</p>

            <h3>Kitty</h3>
            <p>Takes reduced magical damage. Requires two Batman for Wave 40, three or four for Wave 50. Impossible for low sb players beyond Wave 60.</p>

            <h3>Worm</h3>
            <p>Reduces mana recovery on random units for 20 waves.</p>

            <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
            <p>This guide is tailored for players with a lower sb level (<= 6). Hell mode requires significantly higher damage output due to debuffs and the need for more lances and attack speed compared to hard mode. The % damage from lance is debuffed by 70%, requiring at least 6 level 12 lances. Hell mode introduces RNG elements, making success reliant on luck, patience, and teamwork.</p>
