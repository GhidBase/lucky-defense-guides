        <p>
          It's never been a better time to start attempting hell mode runs than
          it is now - the recent nerfs to the mode made it significantly less
          difficult to get wins with more attainable gear. However, it's still a
          difficult mode. To beat it you'll need a solid strategy. With the
          variety of mythics that have been added to the game over the last
          couple months, you have some good options available to you. This guide
          will go over all of the mythics that are currently in the hell mode
          meta, and will explain the physical build I use currently. Note that
          magic builds are very popular right now. It's reccomended you wait
          until Safe Box level 6 to attempt hell mode. This physical build is
          designed to give you the best odds of winning with somebody who is not
          at Safe Box 6 yet. If you <b>are</b> playing with somebody who has
          Safe Box 6, you can use a magic strategy which is lower effort to use
          because it doesn't rely on defense reduction, and is easily improved
          with attack speed buffs. I'll cover both the physical build strategy
          and the magic strategy below. The information will be mostly combined
          as they use a lot of the same things.
        </p>

        <h2>Safe Box and Money Gun</h2>
        <p>
          Safe Box and Money Gun are important in every mode you've played. But
          in hell mode you'll need to stack more gold than you have ever
          stacked. You should try to get to 30k gold before you start spending
          very much of it. Shoot for at LEAST 400k by the end of the match.
          You'll need to learn to optimize your missions at the start to do this
          - recruit all commons, kill hunt before wave 8, sell 10 units (sell
          your commons for this, you get some gold back AND you get the gold
          from the mission) and whatever other mission there is I can't think of
          off the top of my head. Note that unlike in hard mode, there's no
          mission for upgrading twice in hell mode. You can save a little extra
          gold if you can kill the hunts without having to upgrade your epic
          damage. Don't upgrade common or rare damage - you need all the gold
          you can get, and you'd only benefit from that upgrade for maybe 10
          waves. Epics can clear wave 20 in some cases - use them! Also, you
          likely learned to avoid maxxing summon chance in lower difficulties.
          Most players still avoid this. Since we're trying to beat hell mode
          and potentially even carry it, sometimes it can work in your favor to
          max it out. I did that in this video, but if you have a good partner,
          don't max your summon chance. You're going to need those commons to
          summon mythics later. I stay between 6 and 9 tops if I have a good
          partner.
        </p>

        <h1>The Three Types of Mythics</h1>
        <h2>Boss Killers - Lancelot, Vayne, and Watt</h2>
        <h3>Lancelot 12 - The % Boss Killer</h3>
        <p>
          Lance is the classic boss killer. His damage is nerfed a good bit in
          hell mode, but he's still very powerful and 100% worth summoning. I
          often will summon 3 to carry a player. It's important to note that he
          is countered by Barrier. If you get a Barrier boss, you can not kill
          it with Lancelot.
        </p>
        <h3>Vayne 15 - The Physical Boss Killer</h3>
        <p>
          Vayne level 15 and Watt 12 are the direct counter to barrier. Aside
          from that, Vayne does massive damage to all of the other bosses as
          well. Surprisingly, she also does high damage to Grunt, who
          specifically resists physical damage. She scales off gold unlike
          Lance, so having her maxxed out with her exclusive treasure can make
          the difference between a win and a loss.
        </p>
        <h3>Watt 12 - The Build Up Boss Killer</h3>
        <p>
          Watt 12 is technically the strongest unit in the game, but only for
          brief bursts of damage. Watt is particularly good when you and your
          partner are at least SB6. The reason for this, is with two SB6
          players, there's not much risk of losing before wave 80. Wave 80 is
          often where people fail though. Not only that, but as mentioned above,
          Barrier is practically immune to Lancelot's ult damage because Lance
          does damage based on max health, and Barrier's outer shield has 8 to 9
          times the amount of health that his real health bar has.
        </p>
        <h2>Wave Clear Mythics - Tao, Chu, Bat Man, Verdee and Kun</h2>
        <h3>S Tier - Tao and Chu level 12</h3>
        <p>
          These are the absolute strongest wave clears in the game. These are
          going to give you the best odds of getting through hordes to get to
          the boss rounds. There's not much to add here. They're extremely
          strong
        </p>
        <h3>A/B Tier - Verdee, Bat Man, and Kun</h3>
        <p>
          If you're playing in an SB6 team, you can get away with using more of
          these. However, if you're trying to carry, you should only use one of
          these if you haven't been able to get an Overclocked Chu or Tao. If
          you do have to get one, do not get a second one - they don't do enough
          damage compared to Tao and Chu, and with the very limited board space
          you have, you'll need to fill it with only the strongest mythics
          possible if you're expecting to do a majority of the damage - you'll
          need a bit of luck. With an SB6 teammate, you can use these more
          often.
        </p>
        <p>
          If you do use one of these, the strongest of them is Kun. He doesn't
          cost gold to upgrade, and if you can get him +80 or higher, he's solid
          all the way to the end. You'll still want to swap him with Lancelot if
          you get lots of mana though, because Lancelot with mana regen will
          still outdamage Kun. The second best of these three is Verdee, only
          because she doesn't cost gold to get working well. Bat Man is the
          worst because the most important thing in a successful run is gold,
          and he's going to require you to spend it. It's worth considering the
          ramp up times that make these units work: Verdee only needs to wait
          until she performs her summon, and then she's performing at her peak,
          as long as you have Defense Reduction. Kun takes the longest time to
          build up, but is as strong as Bat Man, doesn't need Defense Reduction,
          and doesn't use gold to power up. Bat Man <b>can</b> save a run if
          you're just about to die to a boss. He's the best of these three to
          get dealing high damage with almost no ramp up time. Summoning him and
          upgrading him quickly can get you what you need to survive. Note: if
          you already have one of these 3, you can consider selling tiger -
          unless you want him for attack speed, all the tiger summons at the
          moment are outclassed by Rocket Chu, Tao, and Lancelot. If you're
          running a physical build, you can get away with not doing attack speed
          buffs, and often it's beneficial to do so in hopes to stack more
          Defense Reduction.
        </p>
        <h2>Support - Indy and Kitty Mage</h2>
        <h3>Indy 12</h3>
        <p>
          Indy is - deceptively - one of the most powerful characters in the
          game. He's unneccesary in the lower difficulties, but he's a staple of
          hell mode. The biggest reason Indy shines so much in hell mode
          specifically, is because in hell mode, you're often left completely
          filling your board to the point where you have no room. This is why
          above, I reccomend giving extra thought into whether or not you summon
          a second Bat Man/Kun/Verdee. In the video on this page, you can see
          both me and my partners board get completely filled by the end. Indy
          has a variety of buffs, and all of his legendary ones would take
          multiple spaces to get the same effect from anywhere else. The best
          one you can get when doing the physical strategy is Defense Reduce -
          when using Vayne as the boss killer. The best one to use when running
          magic builds is attack speed. The reason the Defense Reduction buff is
          so powerful, is that one Indy can give as much Defense Reduction as
          <b>FOUR</b> Monopoly Men. Not only does this save 3 entire spaces for
          the same Defense Reduction, but running a Vayne/Lancelot strat means
          you're going to be using a ton of Hunters to summon them. It's very
          difficult to maintain stacks of hunters while you're constantly using
          them to summon those two mythics, while you're <b>also</b> fighting
          with limited board space. As far as attack speed goes it's very
          similar. One Indy can give you an attack speed bonus equal to more
          than 3 full stacks of eagles. It's honestly insane.\
        </p>

        <h3>Kitty 12</h3>
        <p>
          The first or second mythic most people get to level 12. You want at
          least 3 of these Kitties to keep your Vaynes in their ult form for the
          entire game. To support Lancelot, it would be better to have even more
          than that. I keep referring to carrying lower level players in this
          guide, and most of you will not be attempting this. However, one of
          the most important parts about trying to do that at only SB6, is
          making Lancelot a wave clearer. Lancelot becomes very good at clearing
          waves as long as he has proper Kitty Mage support. Add in a Rocket Chu
          or a Tao, and as long as you're stunning properly, you can fill the
          remaining spaces you have with Indy and Vayne, to give you the Defense
          Reduction and damage you'll need to beat the boss at wave 80. Lancelot
          is actually the best wave clearer you can get for this strategy, often
          outdamaging Chu and Tao if you can get the mana to support him. Kitty
          Mage is useful outside of this purpose, (Tao does significantly more
          boss damage with his Ult) but this is the synergy that makes Kitty
          Mage one of the highest rated characters in the game.
