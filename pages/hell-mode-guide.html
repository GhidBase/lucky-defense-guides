                    <p>
                        It's never been a better time to start attempting Hell
                        mode runs than it is now - the nerfs to the mode earlier
                        in the year made it significantly less difficult to get
                        wins with more attainable gear. However, it's still a
                        difficult mode. To beat it you'll need a solid strategy.
                        With the variety of mythics that have been added to the
                        game over the last couple months, you have some good
                        options available to you.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This guide will go over all of the mythics that are
                        currently in the hell mode meta, and will explain both
                        the physical and magic builds of the game. Note that
                        magic builds are very popular right now. Generally,
                        magic builds are easier to run at a high level, and
                        physical damage builds have a higher damage threshold
                        due to having the full range of mythics available to
                        them while requiring more micromanagement. If you're
                        trying to beat hell at lower artifact levels, the
                        magical build is going to be more consistent. Note that
                        both builds have a lot of overlap as well.

                    <h2>Safe Box and Money Gun</h2>
                    <h3>How to Maximize Your Gold</h3>
                    <p>
                        Safe Box and Money Gun are important in every mode
                        you've played. But in Hell you'll need to stack more
                        gold than you have ever stacked. You should try to get
                        to 60k gold before you start spending very much of it.
                        Shoot for at LEAST 400k by the end of the match. You'll
                        need to learn to optimize your missions at the start to
                        do this - recruit all commons, kill hunt before wave 8,
                        and whatever other mission there is I can't think of off
                        the top of my head. The gold bonus from these missions
                        compounds very heavily if you can avoid spending much of
                        it until later.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note that unlike in Hard, there's no mission for
                        upgrading twice in Hell, so if you don't need to upgrade
                        damage early you can save a little extra gold. Don't
                        upgrade common or rare damage ever - you need all the
                        gold you can get, and you'd only benefit from that
                        upgrade for maybe 10 waves. Epics can clear wave 20 in
                        some cases - use them! Also, you likely learned to avoid
                        maxxing summon chance in lower difficulties. Most
                        players still avoid this. In hell mode, it's totally
                        viable to level summon chance to merge/sell for stones.
                        In general, it's still recommended to keep the summon
                        level around 6 to 9, but this is not a hard rule and
                        depends on the situation.
                    </p>
                    <h3>The Rule of 4</h3>
                    <p>
                        Above, I briefly mention that one of the missions that
                        gives gold and luck stones is killing the first hunt
                        before wave 8. In general, the strategy here is if you
                        get 4 epics, you can kill the hunt by wave 8. For each
                        less than 4, you'll need to upgrade epic damage. This
                        isn't a hard rule, but it's a good way to visualize the
                        mission. You don't want to miss that mission after
                        spending that gold to upgrade because then you miss out
                        on 2 luck stones, some gold, and the gold you spent to
                        upgrade.
                    </p>

                    <h1>The Three Types of Mythics</h1>
                    <p>
                        We classify Mythic guardians into three types: Boss
                        Killers, Wave Clears, and Supports (including stuns).
                        Boss Killers are needed because from Hell onwards, the
                        bosses have so much health that Wave Clears alone will
                        not be sufficient to kill the bosses (unless you are
                        overflowing with Wave Clears, coins and mythic damage
                        upgrades). Wave Clears are what you will be most
                        acquainted with. DPSes which can deal good AoE damage
                        and decent damage to bosses. Supports enhance your board
                        or protect against the new special effects from Hell
                        onwards.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        This section only covers Mythic Guardians. Immortal
                        Guardians will have their own section further below.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Boss Killers - Lancelot, Vayne, and Watt</h2>
                    <h3>Lancelot 12 - The % Boss Killer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Lance is the classic boss killer. His damage is nerfed a
                        bit (-70% HP % damage) in Hell, but he's still the most
                        dependable boss killer and 100% worth summoning.
                        Although he is a boss-focused mythic, 2 Lances and 1
                        Wave Clear can clear the horde waves all the way to W80.
                        It's important to note that he is countered by the
                        Barrier boss. If you get a Barrier boss, you can not
                        kill it with Lance.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Watt 12 - The Build Up Boss Killer</h3>
                    <p>
                        Watt 12 is technically the strongest unit in the game,
                        but only for brief bursts of damage. Watt is
                        particularly good when you and your partner are at least
                        sb6. The reason for this, is with two sb6 players,
                        there's not much risk of losing before wave 80, allowing
                        you to save Watt for the final boss, which is often
                        where people fail. Not only that, but as mentioned
                        above, Barrier is practically immune to Lancelot's ult
                        damage because Lance does damage based on max health,
                        and Barrier's outer shield has 8 to 9 times the amount
                        of health that his real health bar has. This is why Watt
                        is the perfect counter to Barrier, dealing flat damage
                        instead of damage based on how much health the enemy
                        has.
                    </p>
                    <h2>
                        Wave Clear Mythics - Tao, Chu, Bat Man, Hailey and Kun
                    </h2>
                    <h3>Tao 12/15 - Top Magical Wave Clear</h3>
                    <p>
                        Solid magical damage. Also good as his best positions
                        (rightmost column) are usually uncontested and space is
                        at a premium in Hell.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Chu 12/15 - Top Physical Wave Clear</h3>
                    <h3>Wave Clears - Mid-Tier Mythics</h3>
                    <p>
                        These mythics function as wave clears but each with
                        their own drawbacks and generally dealing less damage
                        than the top wave clears.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Hailey 12/15 - Big ATK boost Wave Clear</h3>
                    <p>
                        Hailey is great as she has a huge ATK boost from Star
                        Power which also gets boosted by mythic damage upgrades.
                        Her drawback is that she requires spending coins on
                        summoning to increase her Star Power but increasing it
                        later in the game when you have more coins (>60k) helps
                        mitigate the downside. Having her exclusive treasure
                        will also reduce the impact on your coin economy. She
                        also does not keep up in damage with the top tier mythic
                        wave clears as your sb increases. Another drawback is
                        that she requires a Sheriff to summon, which is greatly
                        in demand to also summon Lance or Indy.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Note: This assessment does not apply to her immortal
                        form. See the immortal section for comments on Awakened
                        Hailey.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Bomba 12 - Sb/mg-dependent Physical Wave Clear</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mythic Bomba is great for wave clears as his basic
                        attack damage increases to 550% AoE damage with max
                        Workout stacks. He requires Tiger to summon (same as
                        Kun), which gives you a viable DPS for Tiger in higher
                        difficulties compared to Kun which starts to fall short
                        in Hell. A small drawback is that he competes with Lance
                        for a melee spot and you may need Lance more for his
                        boss-killing abilities, especially before SB 6.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Kun 6 - Cost-effective Magic DMG</h3>
                    <p>
                        Kun doesn't cost gold to upgrade, and if you can get his
                        Rage at +80 or higher, he's solid all the way to the
                        end. You'll still want to swap him with Lance if you get
                        lots of mana though, because Lance with mana regen will
                        still outdamage any of these 3 mythics. He is also
                        cost-effective, being able to function at just level 6.
                        His drawback is that his damage does not scale up well
                        with sb/mg and he starts to fall behind your other
                        mythics in damage output. Do not summon more than 1 Kun.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Supports</h2>
                    <h3>Indy 12</h3>
                    <p>
                        Indy is - deceptively - one of the most powerful
                        characters in the game. He's unnecessary in the lower
                        difficulties, but he's a staple in Hell. The biggest
                        reason Indy shines so much in Hell is because you're
                        often left completely filling your board to the point
                        where you have no room. In the video on this page, you
                        can see both me and my teammate’s board get completely
                        filled by the end. This is where Indy can help.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        He has a variety of buffs (see the full list here), and
                        all of his legendary ones would take multiple spaces and
                        units’ worth to get the same effect from any other
                        source. The best one you can get when doing the physical
                        strategy is Defense Reduction (DR).The reason his DR
                        buff is so powerful is because one Indy can give as much
                        DR as FOUR Monopoly Men or 5.5 Hunters, saving you up to
                        3 spaces or 5 unit capacity.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The best one to use when running magic builds is Attack
                        Speed. One Indy can give you an attack speed bonus equal
                        to EIGHT Eagles (nearly 3 full stacks). It's honestly
                        insane. No other unit gives a comparable boost to attack
                        speed.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Other notable treasures from Indy include getting luck
                        stones every wave (epic or legendary), or coins every
                        wave (legendary only) which are great for your economy
                        early on. You can then transit into the DR or attack
                        speed buffs when appropriate (W60+ for legendary luck
                        stone treasure, W40+ for the epic luck stone and coin
                        treasures).

                    <h3>Kitty 12</h3>
                    <p>
                        The first or second Mythic most people get to level 12.
                        You want at least 4 of these Kitties to support
                        Lancelot. Lancelot becomes very good at clearing waves
                        as long as he has proper Kitty Mage support. Add in a
                        Rocket Chu or a Tao, and as long as you have a proper
                        stun setup (see the Stun Guide) you can fill the
                        remaining spaces you have with Indy and epics for attack
                        speed/defense reduction to give you the damage you'll
                        need to beat the boss at W80. Lancelot is actually the
                        best wave clearer you can get for this strategy, often
                        outdamaging Chu and Tao if you can get the mana to
                        support him. Kitty is also useful outside of this
                        purpose but this specific synergy is the one that makes
                        Kitty one of the highest rated characters in the game.
                        Other major synergies for Kitty include:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Increasing the chances for summoning Awakened Hailey
                            by increasing the frequency of her ults
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Increasing the frequency of Awakened Hailey/Reaper
                            Dian’s ults for better DPS
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Increasing the frequency of Mono/Indy’s ults for
                            better support
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <h3>Ato 12</h3>
                    <p>
                        Ato is a great support for Physical DPS, having DEF
                        reduction, boosting physical damage, and reducing ult
                        cooldown times. He gives 20 DEF reduction, which is the
                        standard across Mythic guardians with that ability.
                        However, that 15% increased Physical DMG of allies from
                        his active skill is really good as it multiplies against
                        the Physical DMG magnified by DEF reduction.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        His ult reduces the cooldown time of ally ults. With the
                        game design shift of having physical DPS guardians have
                        cooldown ults instead, he becomes the
                        physical-equivalent of Kitty (though less potent). It is
                        also beneficial to speeding up the summon condition of
                        Top Vayne.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Mono 12</h3>
                    <p>
                        Mono 12 is a natural progression from Mono 6. The gains
                        may seem insignificant for the upgrade cost, with level
                        12 only giving a 20% chance to get doubled luck stones
                        on the ult. However, there’s also the 10% increased
                        attack speed which increases the base attack speed (ie.
                        gets multiplied by all other attack speed boosts), the
                        space savings and the reduction in summon breakeven
                        cost.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Saving space is especially important in Hell as there is
                        no Dungeon and hence you only have 18 spaces on your
                        board to summon and to keep guardians. Summoning a third
                        or fourth Mono (as you might in Hard) becomes more
                        dubious when you would rather that space go to a DPS or
                        even a stack of 3x Hunters or Eagles for support. Being
                        able to pack more economy into one space becomes more
                        valuable under such circumstances.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The concept of breakeven is that you want your economy
                        units to be getting you more value than you spent on
                        summoning them. Mono is a luck stone eco unit, so you
                        would want him to earn you more luck stones than he cost
                        to summon. To calculate his breakeven cost, we will use
                        Horn level 1 (for 25% epic roulette rate), Skull Stone
                        level 1 (10% refund), and Gambler’s Wrist level 1 (for
                        10% lower tier guardian) for our calculations.
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            1 Wolf + 1 Tree: 2 / 0.25 x (1 - 0.10) = 7.2 luck
                            stones
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            1 Demon Soldier: 1 / 0.60 - (8 x 0.10) = 0.9 luck
                            stones
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>
                        So we’re looking at 8 luck stones for Mono to breakeven.
                        How much more you want out of your eco is dependent on
                        your personal preference and what alternatives you could
                        have summoned with the components, so we won’t go into
                        that here. But earning 8 luck stones with Mono 12 will
                        likely take you only 3/4 of the time it would with Mono
                        6 due to the 20% chance and the increased attack speed.
                        So 1 Mono 12 is worth ~1.3 Mono 6s and gets better the
                        more attack speed increase you get.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        To top it off, that is before accounting for Mono’s
                        exclusive treasure which returns MP after each ult and
                        at the start of each wave. At level 6, it’s 2% of used
                        MP after an ULT and 9% MP at the start of a wave. At max
                        level, it’s 5% of used MP after an ULT and 20% MP at the
                        start of a wave. That further shortens the time per ult
                        increasing Mono’s eco output.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mythic Stuns (Optional)</h2>
                    <h3>Why Mythic Stuns?</h3>
                    <p>
                        In general, mythic stuns are known for being at worst,
                        weaker than Epic and Rare stuns. On pure stun output,
                        only Graviton 12+ is compared to Electro Robots and
                        Shock Robots (see the Stun Guide for more info).
                        However, there are some side benefits which mythic
                        stunners provide.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Graviton 12</h3>
                    <p>
                        Graviton is the most popular mythic stun. He has the
                        highest stun duration and chance out of all of them. As
                        a pure stun, he's solid. He is good for getting reliable
                        stuns, with less population cost. (1 Mythic vs 3 Rares
                        or Epics) He also now has an immortal form that is
                        complementary to the mythic form.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Orc Shaman 10 Exclusive</h3>
                    <p>
                        Orc Shaman shines the most when you have his exclusive
                        treasure. His level 12 is a decent ability, but in most
                        games you'll (ideally) be able to get close to 200
                        defense reduction anyways. Because of this, the extra 30
                        defense reduction you get at level 12 (non-stacking) is
                        not that impactful. However, having Orc Shaman treasure
                        nearly doubles the frequency his attacks cause stun, and
                        cause enemies hit by him to take 18% more physical
                        damage. This is an incredibly powerful buff to somebody
                        running a physical build.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Each Orc Shaman gives 20 defense reduction which even
                        though is a slight drop from its summon components (15
                        from Hunter, 7.5 from Demon Soldier, 5 from Electro
                        Robot) but comes with ranged stun and the physical
                        damage boost. So you can fill a space you'd fill with a
                        different stun, with a unit that does both stun, defense
                        reduction, and boosting physical damage.
                    </p>

                    <h1>The Three Types of Immortals</h1>
                    <p>
                        We classify Immortals into three type: General DPS,
                        Support, and Conditional. General DPS immortals may be
                        better at wave clears or boss killing but generally do
                        enough damage to support both to some degree. Support
                        immortals are great at what they are intended to
                        support. Conditional immortals should only be considered
                        when you have built up the other more reliable options
                        and are exploring more niche units.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Mythics or Immortals?</h2>
                    <p>
                        When should one continue building mythics and when
                        should one rush for immortals? The baseline is to have
                        strong mythic options for each role as mythics are more
                        consistent to summon than immortals. The unlock order
                        for Hard adequately covers the wave clear roles, so one
                        should build up their boss killers (Lance 12 and Watt
                        12) before considering building their first immortal.
                        That will benefit your Hell clear consistency.

                    <h2>General DPS Immortals</h2>
                    <h3>Awakened Hailey</h3>
                    <p>
                        Usually the first immortal that many go for as mythic
                        Hailey plays such a big role in the early game (pre-sb6)
                        meta. Still very good as both a boss killer and wave
                        clear. Becomes less powerful as sb increases (sb7+)
                        since other immortals will start to outdamage her but
                        still good to have. Also very useful in guild raid and
                        PvP.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Primeval Bomba (recommended level 6)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Super solid Physical DPS immortal. Main drawback is the
                        inconsistency of summoning it (0.1% per basic attack at
                        max Workout stacks). The good news is increased attack
                        speed helps. Bomba’s exclusive treasure also helps by
                        getting to max Workout stacks earlier so you have more
                        time to trigger the summon condition.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Dark Lord Dragon (recommended level 6)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Very good wave clear. Decent damage to bosses but
                        dedicated boss killers still needed. Fairly easy to
                        summon, especially with Dragon exclusive treasure.
                    </p>

                    <h3>Reaper Dian (recommended Level 6)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Strongest DPS immortal in the game. Main drawback is the
                        inconsistency of summoning it. The default average
                        success rate is 1 success every 8 Frogs. Even at
                        immortal level 12, the average success rate increases to
                        1 success every 5.7 Frogs. And there will always be the
                        bad RNG games with no Reaper Dian after 12+ Frogs.
                        Failure leaves you with nothing for your efforts.
                    </p>
                    <h2>Support Immortals</h2>
                    <h3>Grand Mama (Recommended level 12)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Great support for Hell onwards, PvP and Guild Raid. Her
                        +15% damage buff is great for all three. Her ult
                        reviving dead Mythic killed by special boss effects, Chu
                        Overclock failures and Frog curse lift failures is great
                        for Hell onwards and PvP. Her solid ATK boost to the
                        whole board is great for PvP, Guild Raid and stabilising
                        early Hell / God. Her exclusive treasure helps massively
                        in her immortal summon condition.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Chrono Ato (Recommended level 6)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Best support for Physical Damage board. Similar to the
                        mythic form but on steroids. Increases the entire boards
                        DEF reduction effect by +50%, increases Physical Damage
                        based on DEF reduction level, slows and gives Physical
                        allies extra basic attacks. Still reduces ult cooldown
                        except now by 25% (35% at immortal level 6) and further
                        increases Ultimate skill damage.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Super Graviton (Recommended level 6)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Really good for crowd control. Plays a different role
                        from its mythic form which actually makes the two forms
                        complementary. Immortal form triggers recurring stun,
                        has slow, and a suction ult to keep enemies in the same.
                        Plus it boosts damage taken by enemies by 10%. Mythic
                        form has the best long stun (4.5s). Super Graviton + 1
                        to 2 Mythic Gravitons are a pretty solid stunlock,
                        saving you unit capacity on stuns. Exclusive treasure is
                        strongly recommended (at least level 6, preferably 8+)
                        to reduce the cost of summoning Super Graviton.

                    <h2>Conditional Immortals</h2>
                    <h3>Top Vayne (Recommended level 6)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Physical boss killer, solid boss killer. Requires 200
                        def reduce on higher difficulties. Made for physical
                        focused boards.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Ghost Ninja (Recommended for Phys fans)</h3>
                    <p>
                        Physical immortal which doesn’t require any Legendaries.
                        Damage is quite unremarkable unless boosted by Chrono
                        Ato. Summon condition is great for helping summon Chrono
                        Ato as Ato will be reducing the cooldown of 5 Ninjas.
                        See as a supplement to Physical boards at best.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Dr. Pulse</h3>
                    <p>
                        Magical immortal which doesn’t require any Legendaries.
                        Sacrifices your stuns for damage which is highly
                        unnecessary. You usually need stuns more than you need
                        DPS. Theoretically a pretty strong boss killer if at
                        level 12+ and fully equipped with 4 drones.
                    </p>
                    <h3>Suggested Priority for each Legendary</h3>
                    <p>
                        This is the recommended summons for each Legendary to
                        manage your summon/merge RNG. They are generally in
                        order of most recommended but note that if you need
                        units of certain roles (eg. Boss Killers) then adapt to
                        your situation and summon those as required.
