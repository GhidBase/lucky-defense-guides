                    <p>
                        While mythics are extremely strong units, more mythics
                        does not always mean easier wins. Every mythic in the
                        game serves one or more purposes. This is not a deep
                        dive into all the mythics that fit each role, but rather
                        a quick overview of those roles. To make this easier, I
                        also rank each mythic in each section based on their
                        ability to perform at higher difficulties. There may be
                        biases, but I tried my best to make this list as
                        accurate as a tier list can be, having seen all of them
                        extensively in all the different modes and difficulties.
                    </p>
                    <h2 class="section-header">Wave Carries</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are the most popular mythics in the game because
                        their strengths are immediately obvious as soon as you
                        get them. Batman and Rocket Chu are two examples of
                        this. Any mythic that clears groups of enemies with AOE
                        attacks are Wave Carries. Some are good for the whole
                        game, some are only good for the first 20 or 30 waves.
                        But these are required to survive the main waves.

                    <h2 class="section-header">Boss Killers</h2>
                    <p>
                        These mythics don't always stand out right away as being
                        particularly effective. In normal mode, you won't need
                        them. But when it comes to taking down bosses in hard
                        mode and beyond you'll need them.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Note:</b> Despite these units being great at killing
                        bosses, the only boss killers that are able to clear
                        dungeon are Vayne and Zap. The others won't be able to
                        clear dungeon.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        <b>Note:</b> Many wave clears will handle a majority of
                        the boss fights. In general, you'll only need a
                        specialized boss killer for the last few boss fights on
                        the harder difficulties.
                    </p>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Support</h2>
                    <p>
                        Support mythics do things other than dealing damage.
                        Some are strictly support, like Kitty Mage. Some are
                        hybrid, like Iron Meow. But they add a different value
                        to the team. Kitty Mage and Iron Meow increase MP Regen.
                        Monopoly Man gives lucky coin generation and Defense
                        Reduce. Stun mythics also belong here, such as Orc
                        Shaman.

                    <p>
                        At first, these units are outclassed by the standard
                        blue and purple stun robots. That being said, they have
                        their purposes at higher levels and with their exclusive
                        treasures unlocked. Grav is popular to get 100% stun
                        lock in hell, Orc Shaman buffs physical damage with his
                        exclusive treasure, and Pulse Generator has become more
                        common in the top-level Korean Lucky Defense community
                        as of late, due to having good slow with it's exclusive
                        treasure, and doing high damage relative to the other
                        stuns for wave 20/30 in hell.
                    </p>
                    <h3>A Tier</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Graviton</li>
                        <li>Orc Shaman</li>

                    <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>
                        These are the main categories in the game. Keep them in
                        mind when choosing between mythics to summon. If you
                        have Wave Clear covered, consider trying to get more
                        boss focused DPS. If both are covered, you can scale
                        them into the late game by adding some support units.
                        Try different blends of units. Even months into the game
                        you're likely to find units you had thought were useless
                        in the past are good under the right circumstances.
                        Understand the full kit of mythics and you'll find the
                        game leans less on luck, and more on an understanding of
                        what to do with the tools you're given.
                    </p>
                    <p>Good luck!</p>
