        <p>
            While mythics are extremely strong units, more mythics
            does not always mean easier wins. Every mythic in the
            game serves one or more roles. This is a quick overview
            of those roles.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-header">Wave Carries</h2>
        
        <p>
            These are the most popular mythics in the game because
            their strengths are immediately obvious as soon as you
            get them. These are the wave carries:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Batman</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu</li>
            <li>King Dian</li>
            <li>Dragon</li>
            <li>Iron Meow</li>
            <li>Lazy Taoist</li>
            <li>Blob (lvl 6)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            These are roughly in order of what is the most common.
            Side note, with multiple Lancelots (2 or 3) with a
            very high mp regen (400% mp regen or higher), Lancelot
            also becomes a wave clear option, and one that is
            particularly good in higher waves. Pair with a ranged
            wave clear such as Rocket Chu, King Dian, etc, and wave
            clearing should be very easy on hard mode.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-header">Boss Killers/Dungeon Clearers</h2>
        
        <p>
            These are the most overlooked mythics because their
            benefits <b>aren't</b> immediately obvious. These are
            the boss killers:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lancelot (lvl 6)</li>
            <li>Vayne (lvl 6)</li>
            <li>King Dian</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu (lvl 12)</li>
            <li>Lazy Taoist</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            A quick overview of these characters:
        </p>

        <p><b>Note: Lancelot will NOT clear dungeon</b></p>
        <p>
            Lancelot has a passive skill, where every hit he lands deals
            a percentage of the enemy's health in damage. This is an okay
            ability at first. But when he's level 6 he unlocks his ult,
            where he performs a slam attack that creates a cyclone. <b>This
            cyclone deals rapid fire damage, and each does the normal amount
            of percent damage.</b> If you have 2 or 3 level 6 Lancelots, and
            a couple level 12 Kitty Mage's, hard mode is very simple to clear.
            You do have to upgrade Lancelot's passive skill mid-match using
            lucky stones to get him dealing percent damage. Max this out in
            the late game and it's an easy win.
        </p>

        <p>
            Vayne is one of the biggest sleeper units in the game. He does
            next to no damage on waves, if you have Vayne he will <b>NOT</b>
            help you stay alive during waves. This is a big drawback. However,
            Vayne will easily clear dungeon for you. If you have a decent amount
            of gold and mythic damage upgrades, he can even be useful killing
            bosses all the wave through wave 80 on hard. When using Vayne, it's
            totally fine to just move him out of range during waves so you can
            set up a better wave clear board, and then just move Vayne into range
            when the boss comes out.
        </p>

        <p>
            King Dian and Rocket Chu are very interesting characters. They serve
            very similar roles, and both have an all or nothing gamble to make them
            powerful. I would personally say they are <b>NOT</b> boss killers. However,
            oftentimes when you have 2 level 6 Lancelots, you will need just a little
            more damage to defeat the wave 80 boss. More damage than Batman or Iron
            Meow could do. In this situation, King Dian and Overclocked Chu can likely
            finish the boss off. For that to happen, you will need to upgrade mythic
            damage and have a good stockpile of gold (at the very least 100k or higher)
            but they can definetly make the difference between a win or a loss in a pinch.
