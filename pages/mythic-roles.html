        <h2 class="section-header">Mythic roles</h2>
        
        <p>
            While mythics are extremely strong units, more mythics
            does not always mean easier wins. Every mythic in the
            game serves one or more roles. This is not a deep dive
            into all the mythics that fit each role, but rather a
            quick overview of those roles.
        </p>
        
        <h2 class="section-header">Wave Carries</h2>
        
        <p>
            These are the most popular mythics in the game because
            their strengths are immediately obvious as soon as you
            get them. Batman and Rocket Chu are two examples of this.
            Any mythic that clears groups of enemies with AOE attacks,
            these are Wave Carries. Some are good for the whole game,
            some are only good for the first 20 or 30 waves. But
            these are required to survive the main waves.
        </p>

        <p>
            Below are some popular wave carries. The ones on this list can
            beat normal mode without any help from boss killers.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Batman</li>
            <li>Rocket Chu</li>
            <li>Dragon</li>
            <li>Frog/King Dian</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-header">Boss Killers/Dungeon Clearers</h2>

        <p>
            These mythics don't always stand out right away as being
            particularly effective. In normal mode, you often won't
            even need them. But when it comes to taking down bosses,
            clearing the dungeon, and even just taking out your hunts
            more easily, that's where you'll use these. The two most
            popular are Lancelot and Vayne. Note that Lancelot can't
            clear dungeon effectively. Both of these seem weak at first
            . However, when it comes to boss killing power, Lancelot
            is currently the strongest in the game. Vayne is a solid
            option as well as long as you build up your defense reduce
            and upgrade mythic damage.
        </p>
        
        <p>
            Note that there are wave clears that can do good damage
            to bosses and dungeon. This is not true for all of them
             though, and you should try them all out. Notably, Batman
            is great for a big portion of hard, but he won't put much
            damage on the wave 80 boss at all even with damage reduce.
            Try them out, but the strongest one is currently Lancelot.
        </p>

        <p>
            If you're trying to beat hard mode and you're getting stuck
            on bosses, these two mythics are particularly good at killing
            bosses on hard mode:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>Lancelot - Level 6</li>
            <li>Vayne - Level 6 (Can also clear dungeon)</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-header">Support</h2>

        <p>
            Support mythics do other things than dealing damage. Some are
            strictly support, like Kitty Mage. Some are hybrid, like Iron
            Meow. But they add a different value to the team. Kitty Mage
            and Iron Meow increase MP Regen. Monopoly Man gives lucky
            coin generation and Defense Reduce. Stun mythics also belong
            here, such as Orc Shaman.
        </p>

        <p>The most popular, and most powerful support units are currently:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Kitty Mage (Get this to level 12 as soon as possible!)</li>
            <li>Monopoly Man</li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="section-header">Conclusion</h2>

        <p>
            These are the main roles in the game. Keep them in mind when
            choosing between mythics to summon. If you have Wave Clear
            covered, consider trying to get more boss focused DPS. If both
            are covered, you can scale them into the late game by adding some
            support units. Try different blends of units. Even months into
            the game you're likely to find units you had thought were useless
            in the past are good under the right circumstances. Understand
            the full kit of mythics and you'll find the game leans less on luck,
            and more on an understanding of what to do with the tools you're
            given.
        </p>

        <p>
            Good luck!
        </p>
