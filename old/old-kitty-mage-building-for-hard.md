                                Kitty Mage aka Kitty is the mythic to get after
                                Lancelot and your first support mythic. Its
                                skills increase MP Regen and restores MP to
                                itself and allies. Kitty requires an Eagle
                                (epic), two Water Elementals (common) and an
                                Archer (common) to summon.

                                When levelled to level 12, Kittyâ€™s skills
                                increasing MP Regen get +100% effectiveness. Her
                                passive MP Regen of 20% increases to 40%. Her
                                ult restores 20 MP instead of 10 MP to allies
                                within range. Note that there is a typo in-game
                                for the skill; it is 20MP / 10 MP flat instead
                                of 20% / 10%.

                                With your current mythic collection, Kitty
                                boosts Lancelot, Hailey and Master Kun by making
                                their ults more frequent. Without Kitty, you
                                will have a difficult time using Lancelot
                                effectively in Hard mode (and higher
                                difficulties).
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                With Kitty 12 and Lance 6, you will be able to
                                attempt and semi-consistently clear Hard from
                                sb3 onwards.
